# Credits

Argentum is other people's work with additions on top.

Two lists live in the app — `src/argentum/credits.ts`, which is Argentum's own,
and RapidRAW's inherited Special Thanks under *Settings -> About*. This file is
the whole picture in one place, because a reader on GitHub should not have to
install the app to find out whose work this is.

**The rule:** a project is credited when something of theirs is actually
shipped — not when we plan to take it, and not when we merely admired it. When
what we took changes, the wording changes with it.

## Built on

### [RapidRAW](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW) — Timon Käch

Argentum is a fork of RapidRAW. The interface, the GPU render pipeline, the
catalogue, masking, inpainting, export, presets, tethering and very nearly all
of the application are his.

To be blunt about the proportions: almost everything you touch in Argentum is
Timon's work. Argentum changed what happens to the colour.

Licensed AGPL-3.0, which Argentum inherits unchanged.

### [darktable](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable)

The source of Argentum's automatic white balance, and the reference it is measured
against. What has actually been taken:

| What | darktable source | Shipping? |
|---|---|---|
| Automatic white balance | `src/iop/channelmixerrgb.c`, `_auto_detect_WB()` @ `98a9ade9` | Yes |
| Sigmoid tone curve | `src/iop/sigmoid.c`, `_generalized_loglogistic_sigmoid` | Ported, then reverted — the code is in the tree at `mods/sigmoid.rs` but nothing calls it |

The sigmoid row is listed because the code is distributed, not because it runs.
Leaving it uncredited because it is currently disconnected would be the wrong
way round.

Beyond those two, darktable's *behaviour* is the yardstick — the comparison
harness in `mods/colour_compare.rs` measures Argentum against darktable renders
of the same files. Method that came from reading darktable, rather than copied
code, is noted in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) where it applies.

Licensed GPL-3.0-or-later.

## Camera profiles

### [RawTherapee](https://github.com/RawTherapee/RawTherapee)

Argentum reads DCP camera profiles but **ships none**. The free collections are
published with their authors' individual permission rather than under a licence
that lets anyone else redistribute them — so when Argentum fetches a profile for
your camera, it comes from RawTherapee's collection, from the project that
published it, not from us.

## RAW rendering

DNG Standard, under RAW > Rendering, is the default picture of a DNG renderer:
the camera's exposure offset and Adobe's default tone curve, applied as Adobe
applies it. Three sources:

### [RAWmakase](https://github.com/pch/rawmakase)

DNG Standard - the look every RAW now starts in - follows RAWmakase's default
rendering, its *Standard* profile with Lightroom's default sharpening:

- **The exposure offset for each camera body** is RAWmakase's camera table
  (`data/cameras.toml` @ `7c3c81ab`), measured by its contributors against Camera
  Raw - 230 bodies across 10 makes, kept in Argentum as
  `src-tauri/src/mods/dng_baseline.tsv`.
- **The approach** - camera matrix, exposure offset, then Adobe's default tone
  curve applied so hues hold - is the one RAWmakase's Standard profile takes.
- **The default sharpening** (Sharpen 25 at radius 1) was matched against
  RAWmakase 0.3.3's render of Camera Raw's defaults on 200% crops.

**The presets that come with Argentum** are RAWmakase's (`assets/presets` @
`7c3c81a`, MIT): Color, Creative, Curve, Grain and Vignetting, 20 Lightroom XMP
files shipped unchanged in `src-tauri/resources/presets/rawmakase` with their
licence, and read through Argentum's own XMP import. Its six B&W presets are not
included yet. The Amount slider for a preset follows its rule: it starts from the
photo as it was and moves only what the preset changes.

RAWmakase is also where the comparison started: it showed that the flatness of
Argentum's default rendering was the tone, not the decoder. What Argentum does not
take from it: its own decoder and demosaic, its *Color* look, its measured
highlight and shadow tables, and its default colour noise reduction. MIT licence, in
full in [docs/licenses/RAWmakase-MIT.txt](docs/licenses/RAWmakase-MIT.txt).

### [RawTherapee](https://github.com/RawTherapee/RawTherapee)

How the curve is applied - to each pixel's largest and smallest channel, the
middle one kept in its place between them - is RawTherapee's
`AdobeToneCurve::RGBTone` (`rtengine/curves.h` @ `46b92d8e`), ported to the GPU as
`rt_rgb_tone`. The curve's 1025 samples are copied from RawTherapee's
`rtengine/dcp.cc` @ `ca9234b1`.

### Adobe DNG SDK

The default tone curve itself is Adobe's, from the DNG SDK, copyright Adobe Inc.,
distributed under the SDK's licence:
[docs/licenses/Adobe-DNG-SDK.txt](docs/licenses/Adobe-DNG-SDK.txt). Argentum is not
affiliated with or endorsed by Adobe; Adobe, Lightroom and Camera Raw are

## AI enlargement and restoration

### [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)

The local 2x and 4x photo enlargement models. Argentum downloads the selected
ONNX artifact on first use, verifies its SHA-256 digest, and runs it locally
through ONNX Runtime. The original project is released under the BSD-3-Clause
licence.

### [OmniLens](https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/OmniLens)

Restore's model, by Qi Jiang and colleagues at Zhejiang University: a SwinIR
network (Jingyun Liang et al.) pretrained on a library of thousands of
simulated lens designs, so it undoes the softness of a lens it has never seen.
Argentum converts it to ONNX, publishes that copy in
[argentum-models](https://github.com/akhater/argentum-models), and downloads it
the first time Restore is used. Code and weights are Apache-2.0.

## Inherited with RapidRAW

Argentum ships all of RapidRAW's functionality, so everything he depends on,
Argentum depends on too. These are his credits, repeated here because they are
just as true of this app.

| Project | What it does here |
|---|---|
| [rawler](https://github.com/dnglab/dnglab) | RAW decoding. The foundation everything else stands on |
| [lensfun](https://lensfun.github.io/) | The lens correction library and its camera/lens database |
| [SAM 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2) | The foundation model behind AI subject detection and click-to-mask |
| [U²-Net](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net) | The architecture behind sky and foreground detection |
| [LaMa](https://github.com/advimman/lama) | Inpainting — content-aware fill and object removal |
| Depth Anything | Monocular depth estimation, which drives depth-based masking and lens blur |
| NIND | The models behind AI noise reduction |
| [NegPy](https://github.com/marcinz606/NegPy) | The approach the film-negative conversion is based on |
| Spektrafilm — Andrea Volpato | The spectrally-based film emulation LUTs. Licensed CC BY-SA 4.0 |
| [libgphoto2](https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2) | Camera communication for tethering and remote capture. Feature-gated: `default = []`, so it is only in builds made with `--features tethering` |

Two entries are deliberately named without a link: **Depth Anything** and
**NIND** have several plausible upstreams and none is cited in the code, so
naming them is honest where guessing a URL would not be.

[LICENSE](LICENSE).

darktable is GPL-3.0-or-later, which is compatible with the AGPL: the combined
work is distributed under the AGPL. Spektrafilm's LUTs are CC BY-SA 4.0 and are
