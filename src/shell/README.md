# src/shell — the new editor interface

Argentum's own editor interface (DEC-29), beside today's. It is opt-in: open
the app with `?shell=new`. Without it, `src/main.tsx` renders today's app
exactly as before. The layout is Lightroom Classic-style: from the window's
right edge a slim rail, the tool
panels under the histogram and navigator, the Presets / Snapshots / History
panel, then the photo with its toolbar under it, and the filmstrip along the
bottom. The rail holds the tabs; a tool mode (crop, spot removal, masking)
joins it when a tool declares one.

## Rules it is built on

- **No tool-specific interface code.** Panels are built from the engine's
  `ToolDescriptor`s. A new engine tool gets its panel with no change here;
  `tests/newTool.test.tsx` proves it and fails if any file outside `engine/`
  and `locales/` names a tool.
- **One source of truth.** Contract types come from `contract.generated.ts`,
  generated from `src-tauri/engine/src/contract.rs` with its fixtures in
  `contract.fixtures.json`. Never edit either by hand; import from
  `contract.ts`.
- **Edits are patches.** Every change sends the engine an `EditPatch`. Undo
  keeps each step's patch and its inverse, never a copy of the document.
- **Latest wins, and only the photo shown.** A frame or histogram for another
  photo, or for an older ticket than one already seen, is dropped, and so are
  pixels that arrive after a newer frame.
- **The engine only through the client.** `engine/client.ts` is the one door.
  Until the engine is wired into the app, the door opens on `engine/fake.ts`.

## Layout of the folder

| Path                    | What                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `switch.tsx`            | The door from `src/main.tsx`: `?shell=new` loads the shell, anything else today's app |
| `Shell.tsx`             | The window: top bar, photo and toolbar, side tabs, tool panels, rail, filmstrip       |
| `store.ts`              | The one zustand store, made of slices; the photo open and the panels' own state       |
| `historySlice.ts`       | The edit, its undo history, presets and snapshots, and patches on their way           |
| `viewSlice.ts`          | Zoom and centre, renders asked for by ticket, the latest frame and histogram          |
| `view.ts`               | Photo-to-screen maths: fit, the view to ask for, points, parts, frames                |
| `ShellContext.tsx`      | `useShell(selector)`, the only way components read the store                          |
| `edit.ts`               | The edit document and patches as plain functions: apply, inverse, compose, diff       |
| `contract.ts`           | Re-exports the generated contract types                                               |
| `engine/client.ts`      | `EngineClient`: tools, open, apply, view, frame pixels, events                        |
| `engine/fake.ts`        | The contract fake: the engine's descriptors from the fixtures, its rules for patches  |
| `engine/fakePaint*.ts`  | The fake's pixels, painted in a worker                                                |
| `panels/model.ts`       | Descriptors to sections; value formatting                                             |
| `panels/PanelStack.tsx` | Sections, tool blocks and setting rows, from descriptors                              |
| `widgets/`              | `WIDGETS`, one per kind: `Slider` (float, int), `Toggle` (bool), `Choice` (choice)    |
| `layout/`               | Viewer, toolbar, histogram, navigator, side tabs, rail, filmstrip                     |
| `i18n.ts`, `locales/`   | The shell's own strings, apart from the app's                                         |
| `tests/`                | Vitest: `npm run test:shell`                                                          |

## How a panel appears from a descriptor

1. The store asks the client for `sections()` and `tools()` once and keeps
   both.
2. `buildSections` puts the tools in the sections the engine listed, in the
   engine's order, with the engine's labels; tools by `order` within each.
   Empty sections are left out. The interface holds no section order and no
   section names.
3. `PanelStack` draws a collapsible section per group, a block per tool (its
   label, its origin, a reset), and a row per setting. Settings marked
   `advanced` sit under **More**.
4. Each row takes `WIDGETS[spec.kind]`, a record with an entry for every kind
   the contract has, so a kind without a widget does not compile. A float with
   `scale: "log"` moves by ratio, so a multiplier's 1 sits mid-rail.
5. A row reads its value with `useShell((s) => valueOf(s.doc, tool.id, spec))`:
   the edit's value or the descriptor's default. Only that row re-renders when
   it changes. A setting with `enabledWhen` is shown disabled while the other
   setting does not have that value.
6. A change calls `setSetting(toolId, key, value)`. The store applies the
   patch at once, records it with its inverse, and sends it to the engine.
   Ticks of one slider drag are one undo step. If the engine refuses a patch,
   that change alone is rolled back and the error is shown.
7. Labels are i18n keys from the descriptors (`sections.<id>`,
   `tools.<id>.label`, `tools.<id>.<key>`, choices
   `tools.<id>.<key>.<value>`), looked up in `locales/en.json`. A key with no
   string is shown as words made from the key, so a tool is readable before it
   is translated. The locale file is flat, because a choice's key sits under
   its setting's own key.

Adding a widget kind (a curve, a colour) is one component and one entry in
`WIDGETS` (`widgets/index.ts`). Nothing names a tool.

## Contract gaps still open

- **Frame pixels.** A `frame` event carries a ticket, a photo and a size, and
  the pixels are fetched separately. `EngineClient.frame(ticket)` stands for
  that until the transport is decided.
- **Thumbnails.** The filmstrip has nothing to show for a photo that is not
  open.

## Running it

```bash
npm run dev          # Vite, then open http://localhost:1420/?shell=new
npm run test:shell   # the shell's tests
```

In a plain browser the shell runs on the contract fake. Today's app needs
Tauri, so it does not load there; the switch keeps the two apart.
