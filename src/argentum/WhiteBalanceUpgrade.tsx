/**
 * White balance saved before RapidRAW 1.6.5, converted. Ours, and draws nothing.
 *
 * 1.6.5's Temperature and Tint mean something different from the ones they
 * replaced, so an edit saved earlier would change colour. `mods/wb_legacy.rs`
 * does the conversion; this decides when, because the places their code reads
 * an edit — `load_metadata`, `get_all_adjustments_from_json` — are files with
 * no anchor allowance left, and an allowance does not go up for a feature.
 *
 * Two things, both through their own machinery:
 *
 * - **A folder sweep.** When the library lists a folder, Rust converts the old
 *   edits in it and saves them through their `save_metadata_and_update_thumbnail`,
 *   which keeps the rest of the sidecar and redraws the thumbnail, so the grid
 *   and any batch export see the converted edit. One at a time, each waiting for
 *   its thumbnail: the first version fired every save at once, each redraw
 *   decoded a whole RAW on a thread of its own, and on a real first start the
 *   preview worker died under it. See wb_legacy::save_in_turn.
 * - **The open photo.** The editor may have loaded an old edit before the sweep
 *   reached it — session restore at launch, or a quick click. Their loader
 *   fills in `whiteBalance: null`, so the next save would store the old numbers
 *   as new ones and fix the wrong colour for good. So when the editor holds a
 *   photo whose saved edit is old, and its white balance numbers are still the
 *   old ones, only those numbers are replaced, as a fresh load (history reset)
 *   rather than an edit, and saved. Anything else already changed is kept.
 *   Rust remembers what it converted this session, so the answer is the same
 *   whether or not the sweep has saved the file yet.
 *
 * Each path is looked at once per session; a converted edit carries the
 * `whiteBalance` key and is never converted again.
