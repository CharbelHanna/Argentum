/**
 * The camera profile control in the Color panel. Ours.
 *
 * One dropdown, always: Built-in, any profile the library holds for this
 * camera, and "Find one…" while RawTherapee's profile for it is not here yet.
 *
 * WHAT THIS WENT THROUGH, SO IT IS NOT REPEATED
 *
 * It was a checkbox, and the choice was per camera. Both were wrong.
 *
 * A checkbox says "on or off". The semantics are "one of several" — a camera
 * can have a maker's rendering, someone's calibration, your own — and only one
 * applies. That is a dropdown, and it always was.
 *
 * Per camera was wrong for a better reason. I argued a profile is a
 * calibration and calibrations belong to equipment, which is true of the
 * physics and irrelevant to the person using it: profiles differ in look, and
 * what you actually do is try one on the photo in front of you and compare.
 * A setting you cannot compare on the picture you care about is barely a
 * setting. So it is an adjustment, saved to the photo's sidecar, undone and
 * copied like every other one.
 *
 * It also told the user to "reopen the photo to see a change", twice, in a
 * paragraph, in a panel 180 pixels wide. Changing it does need the RAW decoded
 * again — but that is `load_image`, which the app already has, so it does it.
 *
 * Then, with no profile installed, the dropdown became the words "Built-in"
 * under the label and "Find one" became a button beside it: a choice shown as
 * a fact, and the way to widen it somewhere else. Finding one is a way of
 * choosing one, so it is the last entry in the list. What it finds is
 * selected; when nothing is published the list goes back to what it was and
 * stops offering.
