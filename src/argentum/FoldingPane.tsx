/**
 * A pane that folds by its heading, and stays folded. Ours.
 *
 * For today's panels whose parts are a heading over their controls rather
 * than their CollapsibleSection, such as the Crop tab's Aspect Ratio,
 * Rotation, Orientation, Transform and Lens Correction. The heading is theirs
 * (Text, heading variant) with a chevron in front; what was beside it, such as
 * the overlay and orientation buttons, stays beside it and does not fold the
 * pane. Which panes are folded is kept with the layout (editorLayout.ts
 * panels.folded), by an id such as "crop.rotation".
