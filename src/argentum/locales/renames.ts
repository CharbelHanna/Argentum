/**
 * Their strings, worded differently. Ours.
 *
 * WHY NOT EDIT THEIR LOCALE FILES
 *
 * Because there are fifteen of them and upstream edits them every release. A
 * changed word there is a line in each, in the files most likely to conflict,
 * and a rename is exactly the change that should cost nothing. So the word is
 * replaced in i18next at startup: their key, our value. Their files keep
 * saying what they said, and every place that reads the key shows ours.
 *
 * If a key here is ever renamed upstream, the override lands on a key nobody
 * reads and their wording comes back. That is the right failure: an old label
 * beats a merge conflict.
 *
 * SUBJECT IS OBJECT
 *
 * Their Subject mask selects whatever you draw a box round. Lightroom calls
 * that Select Object; its Select Subject is one click and finds the main thing
 * by itself, which is what our Foreground does. A photographer coming from
 * Lightroom reads "Subject" as the wrong tool, so it says Object, in each
 * language in Lightroom's own word for it.
 *
 * Only the label changes. The type stays `ai-subject`, so every saved mask
 * still loads, and a mask already named "Subject" keeps that name: their code
 * stores the label as the mask's name when it is created, and that is the
 * user's to change.
