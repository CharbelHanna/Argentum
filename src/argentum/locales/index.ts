/**
 * Argentum's own translations. Ours.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE NAMESPACE
 *
 * i18next only reads the files it is given, and RapidRAW gives it thirteen —
 * one per language. Putting a feature's strings there means thirteen edited
 * files per feature, in files upstream also edits, forever. It is the largest
 * per-feature cost in the whole fork and the one that scales worst.
 *
 * So Argentum gets its own namespace, `ag`, registered here at startup.
 * A new string costs one line in `locales/en.json` next door and nothing at all
 * in theirs. Use it as `t('ag:wbMenuTooltip')`.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS IN THEIRS
 *
 * The rebrand — "RapidRAW" becoming "Argentum" inside their existing sentences,
 * and `.rrdata` becoming `.agdata`. Those are edits to strings that are already
 * there, they happened once, and they do not grow.
 *
 * TRANSLATIONS
 *
 * English only for now. i18next falls back to English for any language without
 * a file, so a missing translation shows English rather than a blank label or a
 * raw key. Add `<lang>.json` beside this file and list it below.

 * once `init` has run, and module import order decides whether that has
 * happened — registering at import time threw
 * `i18n.addResourceBundle is not a function` and took the whole UI down with
 * it, because a module-level throw kills the render, not just the feature.
 *
 * So: register now if it is ready, and otherwise once it says it is. Called
 * more than once is harmless; i18next replaces the bundle.
