/**
 * The photo counts in the Modern folder column: how many photos each folder on
 * screen holds directly, not counting its subfolders. Ours.
 *
 * A row asks for its count when it shows, and the number arrives after the
 * folder has opened (mods/folder_counts.rs reads that one folder's listing).
 * Today's tree instead adds up every folder below before it shows any, which
 * on a whole disk is a scan of the disk. A few counts run at once; a row that
 * goes before its count started takes its request with it. Counts are kept
 * until the column is read again (refreshModernTrees), so folding and
 * unfolding costs nothing.
