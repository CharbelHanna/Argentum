/**
 * What is planned, in a few lines. Ours.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT `docs/ROADMAP.md`
 *
 * That file is the working plan — effort estimates, ordering arguments, notes
 * to whoever is building it. This is the short version someone running the app
 * would want: what works, what is next, and roughly in what order. Different
 * audience, different document.
 *
 * It is short on purpose. A roadmap nobody can read in ten seconds is a wish
 * list, and every line here is a promise that has to be kept or removed.
 *
 * WHY DONE ITEMS STAY, AND STAY AT THE BOTTOM
 *
 * A roadmap that deletes what it delivered reads as though nothing has been
 * delivered. Keeping them, each stamped with the release it shipped in, turns
 * the list into a record as well as a plan — and puts a date against a promise,
 * which is the part that costs something to get wrong.
 *
 * They sort to the bottom because the interesting half of a roadmap is the part
 * that has not happened yet. `MILESTONES` below is written in the order the work
 * is meant to happen; `ROADMAP` is that list with the finished ones moved down,
 * so marking something done needs one word changed and nothing moved.
 *
 * Keep it in step with `docs/ROADMAP.md` when that changes.

  {
    stage: 'done',
    what: 'White balance',
    release: '26.37.2',
    why:
      'Real chromatic adaptation in Kelvin, with an auto mode and a picker — replacing '
      + 'three fixed multipliers. Since 26.41.6 the engine and picker are RapidRAW 1.6.5\x27s '
      + 'own; the auto mode is still darktable\x27s, and Argentum\x27s. Lightroom\x27s presets '
      + 'followed in 26.41.8.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'done',
    what: 'Correct RAW decoding',
    release: '26.37.10',
    why:
      'Canon sRAW and mRAW were being black-subtracted twice, which caused both a '
      + 'green cast and crushed shadows.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'done',
    what: 'Camera colour profiles',
    release: '26.37.12',
    why:
      'Pick a profile per photo under Color, or leave it on the built-in matrix. '
      + 'Profiles are found online or imported, and applied while the photo is drawn.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'done',
    what: 'Highlight recovery',
    release: '26.37.17',
    why:
      'When a bright area clips, one channel usually blows before the others. '
      + 'Rebuilds the missing one from the two that survived. On by default, and '
      + 'it does nothing at all to a photo with nothing clipped — which, measured '
      + 'across 400 photos, is nearly all of them.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'done',
    what: 'Clipping preview',
    release: '26.37.17',
    why:
      'The warning button steps through off, L, R, G and B. Hold Ctrl while '
      + 'dragging Whites or Blacks and the picture empties to show only what is '
      + 'about to go — which is how those two are actually set.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'done',
    what: 'Display colour management',
    release: '26.37.17',
    why:
      'The preview now converts for the screen it is on, read from the display profile '
      + 'own profile. Without it a wide-gamut display showed every photo more '
      + 'saturated than it was, and nothing on screen said so.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'done',
    what: 'Sharpening',
    release: '26.41.11',
    why:
      'RapidRAW\x27s sharpening was one slider with no way to see what it touched. Now '
      + 'RawTherapee\x27s capture sharpening for RAW photos, darktable\x27s Sharpen, an eye '
      + 'that shows where each one works, and a Sharpen slider on every mask.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'done',
    what: 'Restore',
    release: '26.41.12',
    why:
      'A lens used wide open is soft from its own aberrations, and sharpening only goes so far. '
      + 'Restore uses an AI model trained on thousands of simulated lenses to undo that softness '
      + 'at the photo\x27s own size, only where the photo has detail, before capture sharpening.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'done',
    what: 'A Lightroom-style starting look',
    release: '26.43.1',
    why:
      'RAW photos opened dark and flat next to Lightroom or the camera\x27s own JPEG. DNG Standard '
      + 'renders them as a DNG renderer does by default - the camera\x27s exposure offset and '
      + 'Adobe\x27s tone curve, hues kept - with Lightroom\x27s default sharpening, and every RAW '
      + 'now starts there.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'planned',
    what: 'White balance on RAW files only',
    why:
      'A JPEG\x27s colours were balanced in the camera, and nothing in the file says what '
      + 'light they were balanced for, so a white balance preset on one corrects twice. '
      + 'Take it away where it cannot mean anything.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'done',
    what: 'Fast on every graphics mode',
    release: '26.43.1',
    why:
      'Auto takes Vulkan on Windows, and on some laptops that was several times slower than '
      + 'OpenGL. The cause was in how the editor drew each pixel, not in the graphics mode: '
      + 'with that fixed, Vulkan and DirectX 12 are 20 to 45 times faster, and Auto is fast.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'planned',
    what: 'Group by date, camera or lens',
    why:
      'The library is one flat list. You can sort it, filter it, and fold a RAW and '
      + 'its JPEG into one card, but not break it into days, or cameras, or lenses, '
      + 'which is how a shoot is actually looked for.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'planned',
    what: 'Offline catalogue',
    why: 'Browse and search photos with the drive unplugged, and relink folders that move.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'building',
    what: '16-bit TIFF export',
    why:
      'Export wrote 8 bits a channel, which threw away most of what a RAW holds '
      + 'and showed as banding in skies once anything was edited afterwards. A '
      + 'TIFF now carries 16, shipped in 26.37.20, and since 26.38.1 you choose 8 '
      + 'or 16 — but the photo still reaches the renderer at half precision, so '
      + 'the file has room the pipeline cannot yet fill. Not done until it can.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'planned',
    what: 'Resize-aware export sharpening',
    why:
      'Give exported files back the edge contrast that resizing can soften, while '
      + 'leaving the editing preview alone. Compare a sharper resize filter with a '
      + 'mild post-resize sharpening pass, then expose a simple Off / Standard / '
      + 'Strong choice and avoid sharpening twice when no resize is requested.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'building',
    what: 'Use less memory',
    why:
      'Measured on a 32MP RAW in 26.41.10: the AI mask models kept 6 GB after one '
      + 'selection, and a photo nothing had changed was copied twice. Both are '
      + 'fixed, so editing with AI settles at 3-4 GB instead of 8-12, and the '
      + 'models unload when unused. Still to do: export, where the 16-bit target '
      + 'and keeping metadata on a TIFF cost the most, and the AI eraser, which '
      + 'works on the whole photo to fix one spot.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'done',
    what: 'EXIF in an exported TIFF',
    release: '26.38.1',
    why:
      'Camera, lens, exposure, date, copyright and GPS survive a TIFF export, and '
      + 'the Keep metadata switch is shown for TIFF rather than hidden while ticked.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'planned',
    what: 'Stack burst shots',
    why:
      'A run of frames taken in continuous mode is one moment, not eight, and the '
      + 'library shows it as eight. Group them so a burst takes one slot and opens '
      + 'to the rest. The timestamps are the obvious signal; whether they are enough '
      + 'on their own is still to be worked out.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'planned',
    what: 'Name what is in the picture, then mask it',
    why:
      'An AI mask needs you to drag a box around the thing first. Instead: look at '
      + 'the photo once, list what is in it — sky, face, the dog, the tree on the '
      + 'left — and tick the ones to mask. RAM++ names things but does not say '
      + 'where they are, so a locating step sits between it and the mask. Everything '
      + 'stays on this machine, and the same names make the library searchable by '
      + 'what is in a photo rather than only by filename and EXIF.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'done',
    what: 'Feather on the linear mask',
    release: '26.41.9',
    why:
      'The linear mask is two lines, where the effect is full and where it has gone, '
      + 'and how far apart they are is how soft the edge is. Both it and the radial '
      + 'mask now fade smoothly, with no line where the fade starts or stops, and the '
      + 'radial mask shows where its full effect ends.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'planned',
    what: 'Skin tones',
    why:
      'The colour nobody forgives getting wrong, and the one a measurement against '
      + 'another program cannot settle. Specifics still to come.',
  },
  {
    stage: 'planned',
    what: 'Filmic tone mapping',
    why: 'A modern tone curve for high-contrast scenes, once the colour work underneath it is right.',
  },
