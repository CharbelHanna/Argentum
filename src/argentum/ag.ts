/**
 * Calling Argentum's Rust side. Ours.
 *
 * Every Argentum command goes through one Tauri command, `ag`, because
 * registering them individually costs a line of upstream `lib.rs` per feature —
 * see `mods/dispatch.rs` for why that matters. This hides the envelope so
 * callers write what they mean.
 *
 *     const wb = await ag('detect_auto_white_balance', { jsAdjustments, mode });
 *
 * The name, the arguments and the answer are typed by `AgCommands`, which
 * `ag.generated.ts` writes from the Rust side's own types (the `commands!`
 * table in `mods/dispatch.rs`): a name the app does not route, an argument it
 * does not take, or an answer read as something it is not fails to compile.
