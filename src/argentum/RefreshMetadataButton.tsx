/**
 * "Re-read metadata" button. Ours.
 *
 * EXIF is cached in two places that outlive a fix: inside a photo's `.agdata`
 * sidecar, and in a per-folder JSON keyed on the file's mtime and size. Neither
 * is invalidated when the app changes, only when the photo does — which it
 * never does.
 *
 * When lens reading was fixed, already-edited photos kept a frozen snapshot with
 * an empty lens and went on failing while their neighbours worked. It looked
 * intermittent and took a long time to pin on caching. This is the escape hatch,
 * so that never needs diagnosing again.
 *
 * Clears the cache and puts the freshly-read EXIF straight into the store. The
 * first attempt called `window.location.reload()`, which does refresh the data
 * and also throws away the session and returns to the welcome screen — far too
 * much for one field.
 *
 * Edits, ratings and tags are untouched. Only the derived EXIF copy goes.
