/**
 * Release notes, for the person using the app. Ours.
 *
 * WHY NOT RENDER CHANGELOG.md
 *
 * It was tried, and it was wrong. `CHANGELOG.md` is an engineering record —
 * file paths, module names, mergeability budgets, "removed the Ko-Fi donate
 * link". All of it worth keeping, none of it worth reading if what you want to
 * know is whether your photos will look different.
 *
 * Filtering it did not work either. Every pass at hiding the internal parts
 * left more of them behind, because the split is not structural: a single
 * sentence can carry both. The two documents have different audiences and
 * different content, so they are two documents.
 *
 * THE RULE
 *
 * An entry here answers "what changed for me?" in one line, in plain language,
 * with no file names and no jargon. If a release changed nothing a person would
 * notice, it does not get an entry — a version number with nothing under it is
 * more honest than padding.
 *
 * `CHANGELOG.md` remains the full record, and is where the detail lives.
