/**
 * Compact panels, on or off, and how much space between rows. Ours.
 * (Compact sliders until the tone curve joined.)
 *
 * The layout is all in compactSliders.css, keyed on one attribute on <html>,
 * and the row spacing is one CSS variable beside it. This reads both
 * preferences at startup, puts them on the page, and changes them when the
 * controls in Settings move. The controls and the startup read are in
 * different places, so the state sits here rather than in either.
 *
 * Stored in argentum-processing.json beside our other preferences, through the
 * same `ag` commands, rather than in their settings.json.
 *
 * The Modern look is always compact (modernLook.ts forces it), whatever the
 * preference says; the preference is kept for Classic.
