/**
 * How a new photo opens: My Gear's choices for photos with no saved edit. Ours.
 *
 * PER LENS: "Correct new photos", in My Lenses.
 *
 * Every photo opened adds its lens to My Lenses: by the lens database's name
 * when it knows the lens, otherwise by the camera's maker and the lens (or,
 * for a camera with a fixed lens, the body) its EXIF names. A lens joins with
 * its switch off.
 *
 * Off is the app as it was: nothing here touches the photo. On, a RAW photo
 * with no saved edit opens as if Auto had been pressed in Crop > Lens
 * Correction: the lens database's profile when it knows the lens, and the
 * camera's own correction when the file has one (which replaces the profile
 * while it is on, see argentum/lensBuiltin.ts). That is a change to the
 * photo, so it is saved like any other. A photo with an edit is never
 * touched, whatever its lens's switch says.
 *
 * PER CAMERA: "New photos open with", in My Cameras: the camera profile a
 * RAW photo with no saved edit opens with (mods/profiles.rs). Unset, the
 * built-in matrix, as before. A photo with an edit keeps its own.
