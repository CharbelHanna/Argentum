 * Which arrangement of today's panels the editor shows, and how the parts only

 * Classic is today's arrangement and the default. Modern arranges the same

 * General > Layout, read once at startup, and stored in
 * argentum-processing.json beside Compact panels through the same `ag`
 * commands (mods/editor_layout.rs), not in their settings.json.
 *
 * Everything else the arrangement remembers is today's own state, saved where
 * it always was: panel widths and folds (useUIStore's workspace and
 * uiVisibility), the adjustment sections' folds, and whether the histogram is
 * showing (isWaveformVisible, which also has its keyboard shortcut).
