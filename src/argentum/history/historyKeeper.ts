/**
 * Each photo keeps its History: in its sidecar, given back when it opens. Ours.
 *
 * Their editor starts a new History whenever a photo opens (resetHistory in
 * useAppNavigation.ts and useImageLoader.ts) and keeps none, so leaving a photo
 * lost its steps. This watches the editor's store, as historyOnRelease.ts does,
 * and no line of theirs changes:
 *
 * - When their code starts a History (one state, the edit itself), the one the
 *   photo's sidecar keeps goes in its place, at the step it was at, if it was
 *   written for that edit and replaying it lands there (historyRecord.ts).
 *   Otherwise theirs stays. Their reset and paste start one too, and the edit
 *   they leave is not the one the sidecar's History was written for.
 * - After a step, an undo or a redo, the History is written 600 ms after the
 *   last change: after their save of the edit (300 ms) and their step (500 ms),
 *   so the two never write the sidecar at once, and every change puts both off
 *   again. Leaving the photo writes it at once, after their own save, which
 *   leaving sends first.
 * - A change their 500 ms had not made a step yet when the photo is left is
 *   written as the step it would have been, as RAWmakase saves a drag still
 *   going (src/edit_session/history.rs @ bf5346d, `saved`).
