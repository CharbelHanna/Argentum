/**
 * Who Argentum is built on. Ours.
 *
 * Grouped rather than listed flat, because the list will grow unevenly. Two
 * projects are the reason this one exists; anything harvested later is a
 * different kind of debt and belongs under its own heading rather than diluting
 * theirs.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT GO HERE
 *
 * The models and libraries that came with RapidRAW. Those are RapidRAW's to
 * credit and it does, inside the app, in its own list. Repeating them under
 * Argentum's name would be taking credit for assembling something we inherited.
 * A dependency earns an entry here when *Argentum* brought it in.
