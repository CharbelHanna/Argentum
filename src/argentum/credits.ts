/**
 * Who Argentum is built on. Ours.
 *
 * Grouped rather than listed flat, because the list will grow unevenly. Two
 * projects are the reason this one exists; anything harvested later is a
 * different kind of debt and belongs under its own heading rather than diluting
 * theirs.
 *
 * WHAT CAME WITH RAPIDRAW
 *
 * The models and libraries RapidRAW brought have a group of their own, last,
 * headed as inherited: RapidRAW's own list of them is no longer shown since its
 * acknowledgements left the General tab, and they ship here just the same.
 * Under any other heading, a dependency earns an entry when *Argentum* brought
 * it in. CREDITS.md says the same things, in the same groups.
