/**
 * The highlight recovery switch. Ours.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SWITCH AND NOT A SLIDER
 *
 * Nowhere gives this an amount. Lightroom has no control at all — it happens as
 * part of reading the file. darktable and RawTherapee let you pick a *method*
 * and turn it off, because there is nothing continuous to dial: a channel is
 * either being rebuilt from the ones that survived, or it is being left where
 * the sensor gave up.
 *
 * WHY FLIPPING IT DECODES THE PHOTO AGAIN
 *
 * It runs while the RAW is decoded, before demosaic, which is the only place
 * the mosaic still exists. Everything else in this app is applied per frame on
 * the GPU; this cannot be. It used to say "applies to the next photo you open"
 * and did not even manage that, because recently opened photos are served
 * from memory without decoding again.
 *
 * So the switch decodes the open photo again, to one side, and swaps it in
 * when done — see `mods/redecode.rs` for why it is not `load_image`, which is
 * what four attempts at a live camera-profile switch tripped over. Then it
 * asks for one render of the same edits, through the same path a slider uses.
