/**
 * Argentum's entire UI, mounted from one place.
 *
 * THE POINT OF THIS FILE — read before adding UI anywhere else.
 *
 * A fork dies when your changes and upstream's land in the same lines of the
 * same files. The mergeability linter caps how much of their code we touch, but
 * a cap is not a solution: at one or two lines per feature, we run out. Six of
 * their files had already been edited before this existed.
 *
 * So instead of adding a tag to their component wherever we want something,
 * everything of ours renders through a **portal**, anchored to a DOM element
 * they already have. Their JSX never changes. The cost to upstream is one tag
 * in `App.tsx`, once, no matter how much we build afterwards.
 *
 * Anchors must be things upstream already renders for its own reasons —
 * `data-bench-id="undo"` is theirs, for benchmarking. We do not add anchors;
 * that would just be the same problem with extra steps.
 *
 * If an anchor disappears in an upstream update, the portal quietly renders
 * nothing and the app still runs. That is the right failure: a missing button
 * beats a merge conflict, and `useAnchor` keeps looking, so it reappears if the
 * element comes back.
 *
 * TO ADD UI: write the component, give it an anchor here. Do not touch a file
 * of theirs.
