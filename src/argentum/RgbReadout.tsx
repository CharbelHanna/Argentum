/**
 * RGB readout under the cursor. Ours.
 *
 * Answers the only question that matters about a colour module: is it right?
 * You can see that a picture changed. You cannot see whether a patch you
 * declared neutral actually came out neutral.
 *
 * WHY THE COLOUR COMES FROM RUST
 *
 * The displayed photo is not in the DOM. RapidRAW renders the editor view to a
 * native WGPU surface composited behind the webview — no canvas, no `<img>`
 * carrying the live result. Three frontend attempts failed on that, the last
 * one silently: it sampled the only large image present, which is the cached
 * `_medium.jpg` thumbnail, regenerated on save and never while a slider moves.
 * Caught in use — the same spot on a nose read 207/177/179 at correct white
 * balance and 214/189/192 at temperature -100, on a picture that had gone
 * completely blue.
 *
 * So the pixel is rendered on demand by `sample_processed_pixel`, over a
 * one-texel ROI.
 *
 * The geometry still has to come from the DOM, though — see `photoBox.ts`.
 * Colour from the GPU, position from the page.
