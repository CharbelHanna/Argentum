/**
 * The TIFF bit depth chooser. Ours.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS A CHOICE AT ALL
 *
 * Because the two answers are for different jobs, not because one is better. A
 * TIFF you are handing to a client is a delivery and 8 bits is the right size
 * for it; a TIFF you are taking into Photoshop is a master and wants 16. Every
 * other format in the panel is 8-bit by definition, so this appears for TIFF
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT IN THE EXPORT SETTINGS OBJECT
 *
 * Upstream's own version of this (pull request #1466) puts `tiffBitDepth` on
 * `ExportSettings`, into their presets, and threads it through six of their
 * files down to a fourth parameter on the encoder. That is the pattern
 * `CLAUDE.md` names as the thing that kills a fork - and it would also mean this
 * feature owning a field in a struct upstream edits every release.
 *
 * So the depth is Argentum's own preference, stored beside the profile library
 * in `argentum-processing.json`, exactly as highlight recovery is. Their panel
 * carries one marker line and nothing else. The cost of the next Argentum export
 * control is zero lines of theirs, which is the entire point.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT SAY
 *
 * It does not claim 16-bit is better looking, because it is not: at the
 * precision this pipeline reaches, the difference is invisible in a photograph
 * and only shows when the file is pushed hard somewhere else afterwards. The
 * labels say what each is *for*, which is the true and useful difference.
