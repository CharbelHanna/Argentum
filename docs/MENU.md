# The menu — what you can take from each side

> **Historical (September 2026).** The first list of what to take, kept as it
> was written. Much of it has shipped since (white balance presets and auto,
> highlight recovery, capture sharpening, the cameras' own lens corrections),
> and Argentum is public. [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and
> [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) say what is true today.

Pick whatever you want, whenever you want. Nothing here depends on anything
else except the color conversion (built once, during the first pick).

Difficulty: 🟢 = 1–2 days · 🟡 = ~a week · 🔴 = needs a real decision first

## Take from darktable

| What | Why it's better | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| **White balance** | Real chromatic adaptation vs RapidRAW's 3 fudge numbers | 🟢 |
| **Highlight recovery** | 4 real methods for blown skies. RapidRAW basically clips | 🟢 |
| **Filmic / Sigmoid / AgX** | Proper highlight rolloff — the "why does darktable look nicer" thing | 🟢 |
| **Color balance rgb** | Best color grading in any free RAW app | 🟢 |
| **Color equalizer** | Per-hue control that doesn't fall apart on skin | 🟢 |
| **Diffuse or sharpen** | Unique to darktable. Sharpening, lens blur recovery, denoise in one | 🟡 |
| **Local laplacian** | Local contrast without halos | 🟡 |
| **Profiled denoise** | Uses real measured noise profiles per camera model | 🟡 |
| **Demosaic (RCD / Markesteijn)** | Matters a lot if you shoot Fuji X-Trans | ⚪ |
| **Lens correction from embedded RAW data** | Rescues lenses lensfun doesn't know | ⚪ |

⚪ = parked. Real work, no benefit *here* — see
[ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md#for-other-cameras-and-other-computers). Both would
matter for a public release.

**Lens correction — read this before assuming it's missing.** RapidRAW already
has a complete lens correction module: EXIF auto-detect, manual mode, a "my
lenses" shortlist, distortion / CA / vignetting, and the full 5MB lensfun
database bundled. Every lens in the current kit is in it, plus the 5D Mark II
body. **It works on day one.**

The only thing absent is reading correction data the *camera* embeds in the RAW.
That exists to rescue glass lensfun has never heard of — mostly recent
mirrorless. Nothing in the current kit qualifies.

**Demosaic — why parked.** It sits earlier in the chain than everything else, so
it means touching how RAW files get decoded. A design decision rather than a
copy. And the win is mostly Fuji X-Trans; the 5D Mark II is conventional Bayer.

## Keep from RapidRAW

Already there. Nothing to do.

- **AI masking** — subject, sky, foreground, depth. darktable has nothing close
- **Generative AI remove / replace**
- **The interface and the speed** — the actual reason to start from here
- **Tethering** (shoot straight into the app)
- **Culling** (fast keep/reject passes)
- **Panorama, HDR merge, focus stacking**
- **Presets, auto-tagging**

## How the edits are saved

JSON sidecar next to each photo. Original RAW never modified.

```
IMG_1234.CR3          ← untouched
IMG_1234.CR3.agdata   ← your edits, readable text
```

Supports multiple versions of the same photo (`IMG_1234.CR3.2.agdata`).

Every tool you add writes into the same file. Doesn't matter whether a setting
came from darktable or RapidRAW — one list, one format. That's what kills the
"can't continue an edit in the other app" problem.

## Suggested order

Not a rule — just the cheapest path.

1. **White balance** — builds the color conversion everything else reuses
2. **Highlight recovery** — biggest visible save on real photos
3. **Filmic or Sigmoid** — sets the overall look
4. Then whatever you feel like

Anything after step 1 is roughly the same job each time.

Stop whenever. A version with only steps 1–2 in it is a working app.
