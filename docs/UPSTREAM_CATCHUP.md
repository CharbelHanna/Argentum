# RapidRAW catch-up decisions

This is the handoff for future upstream reviews. Read it alongside
`scripts/upstream-decisions.mjs` and the mergeability rules in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). A clean Git merge does not establish that
image processing still behaves correctly.

## 2026-10-07: RapidRAW 1.6.5 (`71a07921..79c2a46b`), released as 26.41.6

149 commits. 31 files collided; 818 overlaps were reviewed, all recorded in the
`79c2a46b` entry of `scripts/upstream-decisions.mjs`.

**Upstream built the thing we built: white balance.** Their engine (log-LMS
Bradford gains, Kelvin from the camera's as-shot data with A/D65 matrix
interpolation, white balance per mask, an area picker on the original image)
does what `dt_white_balance` did and more. Reviewing it also answered the open
question from 2026-09-13: our shader decoded the RAW a second time before
adapting, so its correction was weaker than its own maths and every highlight
above white was clipped while a slider was off zero. **Decision: theirs is
adopted, ours retired** (`modules.wgsl` keeps a note where it was). The scene
linear anchor now holds only the camera profile and sits just before their
`apply_white_balance`. Our picker (`src/argentum/whiteBalance.ts`) is gone;
theirs samples linear pixels, which is what ours was rebuilt to do.

**Auto white balance stays ours.** Detection is unchanged; the illuminant now
goes through their `pick_white_balance` (`auto_wb::removing_illuminant`), so the
wand and their picker answer in the same units by construction.

**Old edits are converted** (`mods/wb_legacy.rs`, `src/argentum/
WhiteBalanceUpgrade.tsx`). The same slider number means a different correction
in 1.6.5: cooling by 50 was 115 mired and is 75, and a tint step is nearly three
times stronger. An edit with no `whiteBalance` key predates the merge. It is
converted exactly (the old illuminant through the same door as the auto mode),
stored as relative values to a tenth of a step where they fit and as Kelvin
where they do not. The first two designs put a line in
`get_all_adjustments_from_json` and one in `load_metadata`; the anchor check
refused both, correctly. What runs: a sweep when the library lists a folder, and
a guard on the open photo that waits for their loader. Presets are converted
once at start-up, with `presets.pre-1.6.5.json` kept.

**RapidRAW Cloud is removed** (`no-cloud`). Since the 1.6.4 merge Argentum had
been starting a Clerk sign-in with RapidRAW's development key on every launch;
1.6.5 replaced that with their production key and a paid Cloud option.
`noCloud.ts` marks their store unsupported before their launch effect runs, the
tile is hidden from our side, and the Clerk plugin, its store, its capability
and the HTTP allow-list are out of the build.

**Settings.** Their Generative AI card moved from Processing to General
(48a124f5), so AI Models follows it, placed under it from the existing slot.
AI-Free mode hides Enlarge too.

**Taken as they are:** guided-filter shadows, highlights, whites, clarity and
dehaze; the Whites rewrite; HSL hue in perceptual space; pick and reject flags
(stored in `.agdata`); export border and padding (native on Rgba32F, so the
32-bit path keeps precision); sRGB ICC in JPEG and PNG; Nikon lenses from the
MakerNote (ours reads Canon first); embedded-preview thumbnails; reorderable and
collapsible sections; Tool Focus; curve fine adjust; Tauri 2.12; Czech and Dutch
(rebranded, with our strings). **Declined again:** their half-float TIFF
pipeline and TIFF depth in presets (ours is global, as at 1.6.4); their edit to
`recover_clipped_pixel`, removed at 1.6.4.

**Fixed in the merge, not upstream's:** `custom_aspect_ratios` arrived without
`#[serde(default)]` beside our field, which would have reset every existing
settings file to defaults.

**Known gaps, and what to look at next time:**

- Canon 1D/1Ds: their `read_as_shot_white_balance` decodes on its own and never
  reaches our anchor, so the Kelvin readout is off on those bodies (the picture
  and the corrections are right). The fix is one line in `raw_processing.rs`,
  which has no allowance; it is in `knownIssues.ts`.
- Apple RAW 9 (macOS, off by default) never reaches our decode anchor: no sRAW
  levels, recovery or profile on that path. Registered under `raw-decode`.
- Super-resolution carries an absolute `whiteBalance` onto the enlarged
  non-RAW file, where their as-shot is D65; relative edits carry correctly.
- Their TIFF ICC (#1752) lands in the encoder arm we replaced: port it to
  `mods/export_precision.rs` when it merges.
- The three commits after 1.6.5 (`ca5feaa3` relight, `1cd88e76` fog,
  `923366f9` staged preview caches) are not in this window. Relight adds a
  normal-map model, so `model_catalog.rs` needs the entry; the staged caches
  add pixel caches `redecode::open_photo` must reset, and move the #1307 AI patch
  hashing into `hash_ai_patches` (re-apply our block there).

## 2026-10-05: correction — the highlight split left blown areas magenta

The 2026-09-19 decision below was incomplete. RapidRAW removed the compression
pass (`85bf424a`, `f00145c1`) and, in the same series, added a post-demosaic
correction (`40cfa3df`) that, among other things, turns fully blown highlights
white. Argentum took the removal and declined the correction, on the grounds
that it would stack on our recovery. That reasoning holds for partially clipped
pixels. It does not cover pixels where _every_ channel clipped:
`highlights::recover` correctly refuses to invent a value there, and the
compression pass had been the only thing making them neutral. From the catch-up
until this fix, every fully blown area came out magenta.

**Decision:** keep RapidRAW's post-demosaic correction excluded, and do its
missing job on our side. `highlights::settle_blown` runs from the decode
anchor after `recover`, on the CFA before demosaic:

- recovery in charge (on, with a measured highlight colour): fully blown blocks
  are set neutral, after white balance, at the brightest level recorded;
- recovery off, or nothing to learn from: blocks with a clipped channel are
  clipped to the level of the first channel to stop, i.e. plain white clipping.

It is not behind the Highlight Recovery switch. The first attempt at this fix
was gated on that switch and verified on a test harness that always had it on;
with it off, the fix did nothing in the app. The end-to-end test
`highlights::end_to_end` now checks the app's own entry point
(`image_loader::load_base_image_from_bytes`), both quality paths, with recovery
on and off.

The lesson for future reviews: when upstream ships a change as a pair — a
removal and the thing that replaces it — declining one half is a decision that
needs its own answer to "then what does the other half's job?".
`highlight-recovery` now registers `develop_internal` and
`neutralize_wb_if_multiexposure` as dependencies, so the next upstream change
to either is put in front of a reviewer.

## 2026-09-23: integrate import dialogue PR #1714

**Decision:** integrate the six-commit upstream PR as a normal merge on an
Argentum branch, after adapting its RapidRAW sidecar references to Argentum's
`.agdata` and `.agexif` extensions. Keep the import settings persistence,
automatic edits and preset application, embedded/sibling XMP metadata capture,
and associated-file cleanup. Register the feature's dependencies in
`scripts/upstream-registry.mjs`; do not advance the upstream reviewed-through
marker because PR #1714 is not yet part of `upstream/main`.

The merge's only textual conflict was the sidecar extension boundary in
`deletion_stem_for`. The resolution retains Argentum's extension and adds the
PR's lowercase/uppercase XMP association cases. The feature review still needs
manual import-dialog and metadata checks before the branch is considered ready
for merge.

## 2026-09-19: split the highlight boundary by responsibility

**Decision:** adopt RapidRAW's scene-linear headroom change, keep Argentum's
pre-demosaic RAW recovery, remove the obsolete highlight-compression operation,
and do not stack RapidRAW's overlapping post-demosaic highlight recovery on top.

The application processing stages floor intermediate RGB at zero without an
upper clamp at `1.0`. RAW decode also retains above-white values before inverse
sRGB conversion. Values above nominal white therefore survive until the later
display/output mapping. This is deliberately separate from RapidRAW's
`raw_processing.rs` post-demosaic recovery algorithm.

Argentum's `mods::highlights::recover` remains the recovery authority. It runs
on the decoded CFA data before demosaicing and uses measured unclipped channel
ratios. RapidRAW's post-demosaic RGB correction is not imported because it
could stack on pixels already reconstructed by Argentum. The legacy
`raw_highlight_compression` setting remains readable and is preserved on save,
but no longer drives a compression calculation. Full-quality decode retains
the upstream 1000.0 scene-linear ceiling; fast/thumbnail decode retains its
existing 1.0 ceiling.

Numerical regression tests cover preservation of values above `1.0` and the
continued lower floor at zero. This boundary was reconciled as part of the
v1.6.4 catch-up below.

## 2026-09-22: RapidRAW v1.6.4 catch-up decisions

The isolated branch `codex/rapidraw-1-6-4-catchup` reviews the exact upstream
range `40cfa3df..71a07921`. The overlap register contains one explicit
decision for every detected overlap (212 entries). The required upstream
review command and mergeability check are part of the final verification.

- Adopt the final Brightness implementation from `86884cc9`, which applies
  Brightness to `base_srgb` after tone mapping. Do not use the superseded
  intermediate shader implementations.
- From `85bf424a`, retain above-white LinearRaw values before inverse sRGB
  conversion and remove the old compression calculation. Keep Argentum's
  pre-demosaic recovery and do not import the overlapping post-demosaic
  recovery. Keep the legacy compression setting only for migration.
- Keep full-quality's 1000.0 ceiling and fast/thumbnail's 1.0 ceiling.
- Preserve Argentum's TIFF rendering implementation: a 32-bit-float output
  target followed by 16-bit integer TIFF quantization. Keep bit depth as the
  existing global preference, not a per-preset property. Add headless
  `--tiff-bit-depth` (8 or 16, default 16; invalid values fail before startup)
  and remove the redundant GPU readback flag.
- Adopt the reviewed neutral-grey canvas, persistent Quick Filter, Vibrance,
  RGB curves, folder-tree sizing, labels, and final Android workflow changes;
  keep Argentum branding and version identity.
- For rawler, keep Argentum's Canon EOS C50 camera data and use upstream
  `934af4b` as the base, where negative-only clipping is already implemented.
  The published companion branch `codex/c50-v164-minimal` adds the C50 TOML
  definition, a one-line test type annotation needed for current Rust test
  compilation, and a camera-catalog test for both C50 modes (`16b9b010`).
  Argentum pins that exact reachable commit in both
  `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`. This is decoder synchronization, not a proven
  R6 III rendering fix.

Earlier full-quality 1400-pixel renders of the R6 III `100_0088.CR3`, using
the existing `94818b0` decoder and the equivalent clipping port at `34eeaadc`,
were byte-for-byte identical (mean, p99, and maximum RGB difference all 0).
The final `16b9b010` branch uses that same upstream clipping implementation
directly from `934af4b`; it differs from the tested port only in camera data
and tests. The source CR3 is no longer present, so the exact 0088 render could
not be rerun on the final commit. This result does not explain the appearance
difference on that frame. The user clarified that the comparison was against
DPP Auto; Argentum looks close to DPP Faithful, slightly darker, while DPP Auto
is substantially brighter. Do not claim this v1.6.4 catch-up makes Argentum
match DPP Auto.

The final-pin RAW-to-preview helper and headless JPEG export both succeeded on
the available R6 III `100_0075.CR3`; the export produced a 6.3 MB JPEG. The
headless run used temporary app-data directories. This is a decode/preview and
export smoke test, not a pixel-equality claim. The original `100_0088.CR3` is
no longer available for a fresh render. The screenshot comparison and decoder
A/B are evidence about one photo, not a camera-wide color match or proof that
every export path is visually identical to the editor.

## 2026-09-22: preserve Argentum's TIFF precision implementation

**Decision:** keep Argentum's separate 32-bit-float TIFF render path. Do not
replace it with RapidRAW PR [#1466](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW/pull/1466).
The PR was discussed and its approach was not dismissed: it fixed the false
8-bit-in-a-16-bit-container output by adding a half-float (`rgba16float`)
render target and writing actual 16-bit TIFF samples. The limitation is that
half-float carries about 11 significant bits, not the full precision of a
16-bit integer render; near the brightest encoded stop its values fall on a
grid of roughly 32 out of 65,535 possible codes.

Argentum therefore built its own path: use an `rgba32float` output render
target, then quantise once to 16-bit integer samples when writing the TIFF.
This is a different implementation, not an unreviewed copy of PR #1466. It
removes the half-float **output-target** bottleneck, but is not end-to-end
32-bit: the input upload and some intermediate textures are still half-float,
so do not describe the whole export as full 16-bit precision or claim its
pixels are always more accurate without a direct comparison. The code's
precision limits and rationale are documented in
[`export_precision.rs`](../src-tauri/src/mods/export_precision.rs); the
implementation history and comparison are in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md),
under the #1466 entry.

**Catch-up instruction:** retain Argentum's implementation and tests while
reviewing RapidRAW's TIFF changes. Keep the work on the isolated catch-up
branch. Do not merge it into Argentum `main`, push it, or publish a PR before
the user has reviewed and explicitly approved that next step. Once the work
and tests are complete, send the result to SOL for the requested final review;
SOL's approval is a separate gate, not permission to merge without the user's
approval.

## 2026-09-13: crop update merged; highlight update temporarily deferred

**Decision:** merge the tested crop/cache update, but stop before the next
highlight/RAW-decoder commit until its interaction with Argentum is tested.
This is a temporary review boundary, not a rejection of upstream's approach.
The user explicitly approved the local merge and cleanup. Publication was not
authorized.

### What is already merged

- Consecutive RapidRAW history through
  `5ad3ba0b000186c6c2ce4637530c6cdbe94c7cad`: Ctrl-drag/Ctrl-wheel crop gestures,
  transformed-preview caching, the follow-up cache correction and cleanup.
- Upstream merge commit `a2159e42`; review/documentation commit `89d6f699`.
- Argentum fix `d94b4536`: do not mount the mask canvas when its width or height
  is zero. Hiding the editor on return to the library could otherwise produce
  a zero-sized canvas drawing error. The vulnerable code is inherited from
  RapidRAW, but the failure was not separately reproduced in untouched RapidRAW.
- Combined with the newer work on main at `3d2cc789`, without conflicts.

This used normal merges, not selective cherry-picks. Argentum's RAW decoder
revision and colour processing were not changed by this adopted batch.

### What remains pending, and why

Pending commit:
[`40cfa3df9c039f9f6adfd77a2c759b1ae788a3cd`](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW/commit/40cfa3df9c039f9f6adfd77a2c759b1ae788a3cd),
“improve RAW highlight recovery and color clipping”.

It contains three coupled changes:

1. `src-tauri/src/raw_processing.rs` adds RGB highlight desaturation after
   demosaicing, including treatment of magenta highlights.
2. `src-tauri/src/image_processing.rs` stops cutting values above 1.0 after
   artifact removal and detail enhancement, while still bounding them below
   at zero.
3. `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` advances rawler from
   `3289454e9a65f5c973594687cca35602fa8181e3` to
   `934af4b213a12b95f77d69529627067056066294`, along with other lockfile changes.

Argentum already reconstructs clipped RAW channels before demosaicing. Adding
upstream's later RGB treatment could be useful, but could also change colour
or apply an additional correction to pixels we already recovered. Changing
the decoder and the handling of values above 1.0 also affects the input to
our processing. These are reasons to compare results, not evidence that
upstream's change is worse or incompatible.

The trial merge had no text conflicts. We deferred it because visual and
processing compatibility was unverified, not because Git could not merge it.
The crop/mask tests did not establish highlight quality. No roadmap feature
was cancelled or replaced by this decision.

**UI/UX review:** this exact commit changes only the three backend/dependency
files above; it adds no interface controls to inherit separately. For later
commits, still review the interface independently even if we retain our own
processing, as required by ARCHITECTURE.md.

### Evidence and limits of the completed testing

- User confirmed masks stayed aligned, exported crop matched, and returning
  from Mask/Crop appeared stable after the canvas guard.
- Thumbnail generation was initially reported slow, then appeared faster on
  retest without thumbnail-generation changes. Its cause was not isolated;
  do not describe this as a proven branch regression or a performance fix.
- Final combined source passed the frontend build, mergeability check,
  20 review regression checks and 7 integration checks. Existing warnings
  remained. Earlier candidate and baseline typechecks had the same 76 errors.
- Native compilation and a real RAW-to-JPEG export passed for the candidate.
  These do not replace visual highlight comparisons.
- Temporary executables, duplicate photos and native build cache were removed
  after approval. Rebuild from Git when resuming; do not depend on the old
  test-folder paths or claim those executables include later source changes.

### How the next session should catch up

1. Check current main, other active work and the latest upstream history.
   The hashes above record this decision, not a claim about today's latest tip.
   Use an isolated worktree and copied photos for comparison.
2. Start with pending `40cfa3df` as a whole. Inspect both the application diff
   and the rawler revision diff; do not treat a lockfile change as harmless
   bookkeeping. Include the current RAW/highlight and export-related registry
   entries in the review.
3. Compare current Argentum with the merged candidate using identical source
   RAW files, saved edits, backend, build profile and cache conditions. Include
   clipped coloured highlights, magenta edges, bright neutral areas and
   ordinary exposures. Compare editor results and exports. Include multiple
   cameras where samples are available. Judge retained detail and colour;
   compile success and numerical agreement alone are not quality evidence.
4. Decide explicitly whether to adopt upstream processing, keep ours or
   combine them. Record the evidence and both processing/UI conclusions in
   the review register. If keeping ours, reconcile that choice within the
   normal merge using our existing anchors and register the remaining
   difference. Retire redundant code and registry entries when appropriate.
5. Run the required mergeability checks and relevant image/export tests.
   Update this document with the resolution and commit hashes. Advance the
   reviewed-through marker only when that range has actually been reviewed.

**Sustainability constraint:** do not keep cherry-picking later updates around
this commit indefinitely. Resolve this boundary as part of the next catch-up
before declaring later upstream history adopted. A normal later merge will
include this ancestor; any retained Argentum behaviour needs an explicit,
reviewed reconciliation. Escalate a growing maintenance burden rather than
quietly accumulating drift. A new published release still needs the user's
explicit green light.

This is the repository record. The separate private project-brain decision log
was not updated in this session because its connector was unavailable; a
future session with access should cross-reference this decision there.
