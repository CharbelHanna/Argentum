// Everything Argentum has that upstream does not, and what of theirs it rests on.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// Line counts are not evidence. The checker used to say a file was safe because
// every deleted line had an added line beside it — and `get_all_adjustments_from_json`
// is the counter-example sitting in this repository: we gave it a fifth parameter
// and rewrote five call sites one line for one, in four of their files. Nothing
// was "removed". The behaviour of every export path now depends on a signature
// upstream owns and can change without a conflict.
//
// So the counts are informational and this file is the gate. Each entry names an
// Argentum feature, a borrowed fix or a deliberate behaviour change, what of
// upstream's it depends on, and what proves it still works. Any file of theirs
// we change must be claimed by an entry here, and once per RapidRAW release
// `npm run review:upstream` shows which of their changes land on these files.
//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT DO
//
// It cannot tell you that upstream has independently built the same feature in
// files we have never touched. `keywords` is a hint over commit subjects, not
// detection, and a subject that says "improve colour handling" will match
// nothing. That is why every release review carries a `sameAsOurs` block
// stating, in a person's words, that the release was read for duplicates.
// Nothing verifies that sentence. It is there so the claim is made explicitly
// and by someone, rather than assumed by a regular expression.
//
// RETIRING AN ENTRY
//
// Entries are never deleted. Set `retired: { recordedIn, why }` where recordedIn
// names the review that decided it: the `release` of a release review, which
// lists the id in its `retires`, or, for the per-commit reviews before
// 2026-10-18, the `through` sha with a `retire:<id>` decision.
//
// `how` values:
//   shadows   their code is left in place and not called; ours runs instead
//   replaces  their code was removed and ours does the job
//   calls     their file calls into ours at an anchor
//   extends   we changed the shape of something of theirs (a signature, a struct)
//   retypes   we changed the meaning or type of a value they still read
//   borrows   we carry their own unmerged fix, marked with // upstream #NNNN
//   rebrands  identity only: a name, a URL, a file extension
//
// A dependency names one `file`, or a `pattern` when it is a family of them
// (thirteen locale files carry the same rebrand and the same feature strings;
// listing each would be noise pretending to be precision).

 * no second register to drift, and no way to edit the record of what we used to
 * depend on without rewriting history.
 *
 * Every id that ever existed was added by some commit, so it appears as an added
 * line in that commit's patch. One `git log -p` reads them all; the first
 * version ran `git show` once per revision of this file, seventy and counting.
 * `-m` diffs each merge against its parents too: two entries in this file's
