// What we decided about each upstream change that landed on top of ours.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS THE ONLY REGISTER
//
// Merging used to erase the review window. The review ran from the git
// merge-base, so the moment the merge landed the base moved and the script said
// "nothing new" — whether or not anybody had looked. The CHANGELOG line meant to
// force the review could be satisfied with one `sed`.
//
// So the reviewed-through point lives here, with the decisions attached to it,
// and the CHANGELOG line is checked against this file rather than written
// independently. There is one register, not two, which is the whole objection to
// keeping a register at all: two of them drift, and the stale CHANGELOG line was
// the proof.
//
// HOW IT IS ENFORCED
//
// check-mergeability.mjs re-derives the overlaps in the range the newest entry
// covers — `REVIEWS[n-1].through .. REVIEWS[n].through` — from git and from
// scripts/upstream-registry.mjs, and fails until every gated one has a decision
// here. You cannot advance `through` without the script asking again for each
// overlap it finds, and you cannot make an overlap go away by deleting the thing
// that caused it: a registry entry retired in the review being written still
// generates its requirement for that window.
//
// Only the newest entry's range is re-derived. Older ones are records of what was
// known then; re-deriving them against today's registry would invent overlaps
// nobody could have seen at the time.
//
// VERDICTS
//
//   adopt           take theirs, drop ours
//   keep-ours       ours stands; theirs is knowingly not used here
//   combine         both, reconciled by hand — say how
//   not-applicable  the overlap is mechanical noise; say why it cannot bite
//
// THE FEATURE REVIEW
//
// Every entry that covers a real range must carry `featureReview`. Overlap
// detection is file-based: it finds upstream changing something we registered a
// dependency on. It cannot find upstream building the same feature somewhere we
// have never touched — no amount of pattern matching does that, and claiming
// otherwise would be the more dangerous kind of wrong. So the batch is read for
// duplicate features by a person, and that claim is written down as a sentence
// with their reasoning in it. Nothing verifies the sentence. It is required so
// that the claim is made rather than assumed.
//
// Run `npm run review:upstream` — it prints the overlap keys ready to paste.

// The v1.6.4 review has many repeated checks against the same shared shader
