// What we decided about each RapidRAW release, and before that about each commit.
//
// ONE REVIEW PER RELEASE
//
// RapidRAW is a source Argentum takes from, reviewed once per release. Each
// review is one entry at the end of REVIEWS, written from the template that
// `npm run review:upstream` prints (run `git fetch upstream` first):
//
//   {
//     release: 'v1.6.6',            the upstream tag reviewed up to
//     from: '<40-char sha>',        where the previous review ended
//     to: '<40-char sha>',          the commit that tag names
//     on: 'YYYY-MM-DD',             the day of the review
//     hours: 3,                     how long it took; it is meant to take under a day
//     features: [                   one line per feature, not per commit
//       { what, commits: ['8-char sha', ...], verdict, why, copiedInto? },
//     ],
//     sameAsOurs: { verdict: 'none' | 'found', why },
//     stillLive: ['path', ...],     their files still run when previewing, exporting or masking
//     retires: ['registry-id', ...],  optional: registry entries this review retires
//   }
//
// Feature verdicts:
//
//   take    merge it as it is
//   copy    copy it into a file of ours by hand, with its source commit;
//           copiedInto names that file
//   skip    not wanted: library, cloud, the interface being replaced
//   decide  they built something we have; why says which one stays
//
// check-mergeability.mjs holds each release review to this:
//
//   * the reviews form one unbroken chain: each `from` is where the one before
//     it ended, and `to` is what `release` names;
//   * every commit in the newest range is in some feature's `commits`, so a
//     release cannot be half read;
//   * a commit that touches the render path or today's interface (RENDER_PATH
//     and INTERFACE in scripts/upstream-registry.mjs) is in at least one
//     feature that is not `take`: their changes there are read and copied,
//     never merged;
//   * `sameAsOurs` is `found` exactly when some feature is `decide`;
//   * `stillLive` never grows from one release review to the next;
//   * upstream is merged in exactly up to the newest `to`, and CHANGELOG.md
//     names that release and commit.
//
// THE PER-COMMIT HISTORY
//
// Until 2026-10-18 the review was per commit: every upstream commit that touched
// a file a registry entry depends on needed its own decision. The last such
// review, RapidRAW 1.6.5, carried 1,242 of them, 84% "not-applicable". Those
// entries stay below as history. Their decisions are still checked for shape
// (a verdict from VERDICTS and a reason), and no new per-commit overlaps are
// derived: re-deriving an old window against today's registry would invent
// overlaps nobody could have seen.
//
//   adopt           take theirs, drop ours
//   keep-ours       ours stands; theirs is knowingly not used here
//   combine         both, reconciled by hand - say how
//   not-applicable  the overlap is mechanical noise; say why it cannot bite
