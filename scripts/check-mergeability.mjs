// THE RULE: Argentum's code goes in Argentum's files, and our lines in
// RapidRAW's files only go down.
//
// Argentum began as a fork of RapidRAW and is becoming its own application: new
// tools go into the engine (src-tauri/engine/), the render path is ours to
// change, and RapidRAW is a source reviewed once per release rather than a base
// merged forever. This script holds that line instead of trusting anyone to
// remember it. It runs in CI as a required check (.github/workflows/upstream.yml)
// and with `npm run check:merge`, and it fails the build when:
//
//   * a file of theirs holds more of our lines than scripts/upstream-ratchet.json
//     allows (the ratchet; it only goes down);
//   * a file from RapidRAW we changed is claimed by no registry entry (coverage);
//   * the registry and the tree disagree, an entry was deleted, or a retirement
//     does not hold up (integrity);
//   * a file of theirs calls into our code more often than its anchor allows,
//     or lost the wiring its anchor exists for;
//   * upstream is merged in further than the release reviews reach, or the
//     newest release review breaks a rule (scripts/upstream-decisions.mjs);
//   * something of theirs we step around is gone from the release we merged.
//
// The render path and today's interface (RENDER_PATH and INTERFACE in
// scripts/upstream-registry.mjs) came from RapidRAW and are ours to change in
// place: no ratchet, no anchor count, no shadow check. Coverage still applies,
// and their upstream changes are read at each release review, never merged.
//
// Nothing here asks a pull request for paperwork about upstream commits: a
// change to a file from RapidRAW needs a registry entry, and overlaps with
// upstream are handled once, at the release review.
//
// Every question is asked of git once, by a streamed command
// (scripts/upstream-git.mjs). The run used to start about 390 git processes and
// take 37-74 s; it now starts about ten.
//
// Run standalone:  node scripts/check-mergeability.mjs [--verbose]
