// ============================================================================
// Argentum's harvested shader maths.
//
// Ours alone — upstream RapidRAW has never seen this file, so it can never
// conflict on a merge. It is glued in front of their shader.wgsl at build time
// by gpu_processing.rs, so anything declared here is visible to their code.
//
// Their file gets one call line per tool, nothing more. See CLAUDE.md,
// "HARD RULE: mergeability".
//
// Naming: functions carry the prefix of where the maths came from —
//   dt_    darktable
//   rt_    RawTherapee
//   gimp_  GIMP / GEGL
//   paper_ a published paper with no reference implementation
// ============================================================================


// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// White balance is RapidRAW's, from 1.6.5.
//
// dt_white_balance lived here from 26.37.2: the slider turned into an
// illuminant on the daylight locus and the image was adapted from it to D65 in
// Bradford cone space. RapidRAW 1.6.5 shipped the same idea, done further -
// Bradford gains in log-LMS, a Kelvin mode read from the camera's as-shot data,
// white balance per mask, and a picker that averages an area of the original -
// so theirs runs and this was retired rather than kept as a second engine.
//
// Ours also decoded the RAW a second time before adapting, on the belief that
// the shader was fed the preview encode. It is not: the render input is the
// decoder's scene-linear output, which is what theirs assumes. See
// docs/UPSTREAM_CATCHUP.md, 2026-10-07.
//
// Auto white balance survives, in mods/auto_wb.rs: it detects the illuminant
// and hands it to their white_balance::pick_white_balance, so the wand and
// their picker answer in the same units. Old edits made with the retired
// sliders are converted on load by mods/wb_legacy.rs.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


// ============================================================================
// THE PIPELINE ANCHOR
//
// One call into shader.wgsl, forever.
//
// Every harvested tool used to cost a line of their shader: one call, one more
// line, one more place an upstream release can collide with us. Ten tools is
// ten lines and looks harmless. A hundred is a hundred lines in the file that
// *is* RapidRAW's image engine, and the merge stops being worth doing.
//
// So their shader calls this and nothing else. Adding a tool means adding a
// line *here*, in our file, which costs their side nothing.
//
// STAGES
//
// Five of them, because tools genuinely belong at different points and pretending
// otherwise would be worse than the line it saves:
//
//   ag_stage_scene_linear  before the tone curve, on linear data. Colour work
//                          lives here: white balance, calibration, anything
//                          involving a matrix.
//   ag_stage_color         after their colour controls, before their Color
//                          Grading: B&W.
//   ag_stage_tone          right after their tone mapper, which it can replace
//                          for a RAW: the RAW tone renderings (see below).
//   ag_stage_grade         after the Curves panel and a LUT, before grain:
//                          Lightroom's colour grading (see below).
//   ag_stage_display       after tone mapping, on display-referred data.
//
// A tool joins the stage it belongs to here, so adding it never touches their
// file, which is the whole point.
//
// ORDER IS THE CONTRACT
//
// Tools run top to bottom as written. A tool that needs another's output goes
// below it. Keep that explicit rather than relying on where a call happens to
// have been inserted.
