//! As-shot white balance for the Canon bodies that predate ColorData.
//!
//! THE BUG
//!
//! The EOS-1D and EOS-1Ds are older than Canon's ColorData block (MakerNote
//! 0x4001). They keep their white balance in MakerNote 0x00a4 instead — a table
//! of presets, the shot's own first, each a triple normalised so green is 512.
//!
//! rawler knows about that tag. `Cr2Decoder::get_wb` falls back to it by name
//! (`TiffCommonTag::Cr2OldWB`, 0x00a4) when there is no ColorData. But it looks
//! for it with `self.tiff.get_entry`, which walks the root IFD chain — and
//! 0x00a4 is a *MakerNote* tag. Every other makernote read in that file goes
//! through `self.makernote`; this one does not. So the entry is never found,
//! `get_wb` returns `[NaN; 4]`, and `develop_intermediate` substitutes
//! `[1, 1, 1, 1]` for a NaN first coefficient.
//!
//! A Bayer frame developed with no white balance at all is green, because green
//! has two of the four sites and the most sensitivity. That is the whole of it:
//! not a colour-science problem, no white balance applied.
//!
//! Measured on the 1Ds file from RapidRAW issue #1678, `91BX8040.TIF`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   rawler wb_coeffs   [NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN]
//!   MakerNote 0x00a4   [842, 512, 633, 134, ...]   576 shorts
//! ```
//!
//! It also explains why the reporter could not dial it out with the white
//! balance slider: those are relative adjustments on top of a frame that never
//! received the camera's multipliers, and the camera matrix amplifies whatever
//! is left.
//!
//! WHY THE SCALE IS DIVIDED OUT
//!
//! rawler's ColorData path ends in `normalize_wb`, which divides by green.
//! The 0x00a4 branch does not — it hands back the stored integers. Those are
//! normalised to green = 512, so passing them through unchanged would be a
//! uniform 512x gain. Everything downstream expects green = 1, so that is what
//! this writes.
//!
//! GENERAL, NOT PER CAMERA
//!
//! The trigger is the condition, not the model: a Canon whose white balance
//! came back as NaN, with a plausible 0x00a4 table in the file. Nothing here
//! names a body. On anything that already has coefficients it does not run.
//!
//! WHY HERE AND NOT IN RAWLER
//!
//! Same reason as `sraw_levels`: rawler is a git dependency, and patching it
//! means carrying a fork of a fork. The upstream fix is one word — reading
//! 0x00a4 off the makernote rather than the root IFD — and worth sending, but
//! this repairs it today without one.
