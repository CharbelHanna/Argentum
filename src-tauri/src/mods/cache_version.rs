//! Throw away cached thumbnails when our decode changes.
//!
//! THE PROBLEM
//!
//! Thumbnails are cached to disk under a hash of the photo's path, its
//! modification time and the adjustments applied to it — see
//! `compute_thumbnail_cache_hash` in `file_management.rs`. Nothing in that hash
//! describes *how the photo was decoded*.
//!
//! That is fine for RapidRAW, whose decode never changes. It is wrong for us:
//! every fix in `mods/` changes what a correct thumbnail looks like, and the
//! hash does not move, so the app finds the old file and never regenerates it.
//! The library keeps showing pictures rendered by code we have already deleted,
//! while the editor shows the new rendering — the same photo, two colours,
//! depending on where you look at it.
//!
//! It cost real time: the sRAW levels fix landed and the library still showed
//! the green cast, which reads exactly like the fix not working.
//!
//! WHY NOT JUST DELETE THEM BY HAND
//!
//! Because remembering is not a mechanism. It has to happen because the code
//! changed, not because someone thought of it.
//!
//! WHY NOT PUT THE VERSION IN THE HASH
//!
//! That is the better fix and it is one line — in `file_management.rs`, which
//! is at 30 of its 30 approved lines, all of them the `.agdata` rename. The
//! rule is that a budget is never raised, so this does the same job from our
//! own side: same effect, nothing of theirs touched.
//!
//! Deleting the files is enough on its own. The thumbnails are served over
//! `http://asset.localhost/...` with no cache headers, and the webview was
//! measured re-reading a file whose bytes had changed underneath it, so there
//! is no second copy hiding in the webview to worry about.

/// 1. sRAW black and white levels (`mods/sraw_levels.rs`), and the removal of
///    the D50/D65 matrix correction that had been compensating for them.
/// 2. Blown highlights come out white instead of magenta
///    (`highlights::settle_blown`). Thumbnails made since 2026-09-23 are pink.
/// 3. With recovery on, rebuilt highlights reach neutral half a stop above the
///    clip instead of keeping a lavender cast (`highlights::FADE_SPAN`).
/// 4. RapidRAW 1.6.5: their white balance, guided-filter shadows, highlights,
///    whites, clarity and dehaze, and old white balance edits converted by
///    `mods/wb_legacy.rs`.
/// 5. Linear and radial masks fade with an S-curve instead of a straight ramp
///    (`mods/mask_falloff.rs`).
/// 6. A RAW nobody has edited starts in DNG Standard, with its Sharpen
///    (`mods/dng_standard.rs`, `raw_tone::mode_of`).
/// 7. Inpainted areas sit where they were painted. Their pixels are stored at
///    full size, and were pasted unscaled onto the half-size RAW a thumbnail
///    decodes; a photo with any now decodes at full size for its thumbnail
///    (`image_loader::load_and_composite`).
/// 8. RapidRAW 1.6.7's Highlights (no jump when the slider leaves zero) and
///    Whites (more range), in `shaders/shader.wgsl`.
/// 9. RapidRAW 1.6.7's Relight on a rotated or warped photo: its normals turn
///    with the picture (`effect_maps.rs`).
/// 10. RapidRAW 1.6.7's camera colour the DNG way for photos with no edit yet
///     (`mods/dng_colour.rs`); edits saved before keep theirs.
