//! DNG Standard: the picture a DNG renderer makes by default, as a RAW tone
//! rendering you can choose. Ours.
//!
//! WHY
//!
//! Argentum's default RAW rendering is RapidRAW's: the sRGB curve, a 1.1 gamma
//! lift and a gentle S, in their raw branch of `shader.wgsl`. Next to Lightroom,
//! or the camera's own JPEG, it looks flat - and the decoder is not why. A DNG
//! renderer does two things to every photo that Argentum never did:
//!
//! 1. **A per-camera exposure offset**, the BaselineExposure Camera Raw gives
//!    each body before anything else. A DNG carries its own; for other files it
//!    comes from a table. The median is +0.15 EV, the range -0.75 to +0.8.
//! 2. **Adobe's default tone curve**, the "ACR3" curve of the DNG SDK. Middle
//!    grey (0.18) comes out at 0.39 - about a stop brighter - with 1.36 times
//!    the contrast at that point and the highlights rolled off.
//!
//! RAWmakase, an MIT-licensed editor that measures itself against Camera Raw,
//! pointed at both; its per-camera table is where the offsets come from.
//!
//! OPT-IN
//!
//! Nothing changes unless DNG Standard is picked under RAW > Rendering. The
//! default stays RapidRAW's.
//!
//! HOW IT REACHES THE SCREEN
//!
//! The same way as Base Curve and Auto-Matched: a 16-point curve made for the
//! photo, kept in its edit as `rawToneCurve`, handed to the GPU in their
//! `GlobalAdjustments`. The difference is how it is applied (`rt_rgb_tone` in
//! `modules.wgsl`): in linear ProPhoto RGB, to each pixel's largest and smallest
//! channel, with the middle one kept in its place between them - Adobe's
//! RGBTone. A colour keeps its hue as the curve brightens it. Applied to each
//! channel on its own, as Base Curve is, oranges drift and saturated colours
//! climb.
//!
//! The curve carries the exposure offset too, so a photo's whole default look
//! travels in its edit, and a later change to the table cannot move an edit
//! someone has already made.
//!
//! WHAT IT IS NOT
//!
//! Adobe's colour. The camera matrix is still rawler's, or the camera profile
//! chosen in Color, and no profile look table is applied. This is the *tone* of
//! a default DNG render, not its hue twists.
