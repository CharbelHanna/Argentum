//! Decoding the open photo again, without taking it off the screen.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS
//!
//! Highlight recovery runs while the RAW is decoded, before demosaic, because
//! that is the only place the sensor's mosaic still exists. So flipping its
//! switch changes nothing until the photo is decoded again, and the switch used
//! to say "applies to the next photo you open". It did not even manage that:
//! the app keeps recently decoded photos and serves them from memory, so for
//! any of those the switch did nothing at all.
//!
//! WHY NOT JUST CALL `load_image`
//!
//! That is what navigation uses, and it starts by emptying the open image and
//! every cache built from it, then decodes for a second or two. Any preview
//! request in that window finds no image. That is the shape of the four failed
//! attempts at a live camera-profile switch recorded in `profile_correction.rs`
//! — a black flash, a preview worker finding nothing — and it would also throw
//! away an AI denoise or panorama result the photo is carrying.
//!
//! So this does it in the other order. The new decode is made to one side
//! while the old one stays on screen. It replaces the old one only if the
//! photo is still the one on screen and no newer flip has superseded it. Only
//! then are the caches built from the old pixels dropped. Masks, AI patches and
//! AI results are kept: they belong to the photo, not to its highlights.
