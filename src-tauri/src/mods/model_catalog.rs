//! Every AI model Argentum can download, in one list. Ours.
//!
//! WHY A LIST OF OUR OWN
//!
//! Each AI feature downloads its own model the first time it is used, into
//! `app_data_dir()/models`, and nothing kept track of what had arrived: a few
//! uses in, that folder holds well over a gigabyte that the user never chose to
//! download and had no way to see or remove. Settings > General > AI Models reads
//! this list to show what is there, download what is not, and delete what is
//! not wanted.
//!
//! ADDING A MODEL IS ONE ENTRY
//!
//! Append a `Model` to `CATALOGUE` below: the files it is saved as (name,
//! address, SHA-256 and size), a label, and one plain-English line saying what
//! it is for. Nothing else changes; the settings page lists whatever is here,
//! downloads exactly these files, and deleting only ever touches names that
//! are here.
//!
//! The feature that uses a model asks `model_download::ensure` for it, which
//! fetches whatever of its files is missing or wrong, as the settings page's
//! Download does: one list, one downloader.
//!
//! NEVER A NEW NAME FOR A FILE USERS HAVE
//!
//! Users already have gigabytes of these files. A file is kept only when its
//! name and checksum match, so renaming one, or moving it to another folder,
//! downloads it again for everyone. A test
//! (`files_users_already_have_keep_their_names_and_checksums`) holds this list
//! to every file an earlier version saved, and `RENAMED` keeps an old name of
//! RapidRAW's in use.
//!
//! The selection models' list is `rm_selection::manifest`, read through
//! `selection_models::files`.

/// One file of a model: where the feature that uses it saves it, fetches it
/// from, and what it checks it against.
