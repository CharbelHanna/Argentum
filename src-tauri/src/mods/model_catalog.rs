//! Every AI model Argentum can download, in one list. Ours.
//!
//! WHY A LIST OF OUR OWN
//!
//! Each AI feature downloads its own model the first time it is used, into
//! `app_data_dir()/models`, and nothing kept track of what had arrived: a few
//! uses in, that folder holds well over a gigabyte that the user never chose to
//! download and had no way to see or remove. Settings > General > AI Models reads
//! this list to show what is there and delete what is not wanted.
//!
//! ADDING A MODEL IS ONE ENTRY
//!
//! Append a `Model` to `CATALOGUE` below: the file name it is saved under, a
//! label, one plain-English line saying what it is for, the address it comes
//! from and its download size. Nothing else changes; the settings page lists
//! whatever is here, and deleting only ever touches names that are here.
//!
//! The feature that uses a model still downloads it itself. This list does not
//! fetch anything, so a model deleted here is fetched again by its feature the
//! next time that feature is used.
//!
//! UPSTREAM'S MODELS ARE COPIES
//!
//! RapidRAW's file names and addresses are private constants in their
//! `ai_processing.rs`. Making them `pub` would be an edit to their file for the
//! sake of a settings page, so they are copied here instead, and the tests below
//! read their file and fail when the copies drift — a renamed model, or a new
//! one upstream added that this list does not know about yet. That dependency is
//! registered as `model-manager` in `scripts/upstream-registry.mjs`.
