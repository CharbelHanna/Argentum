//! What colour the screen actually shows. Ours.
//!
//! THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR
//!
//! Argentum's pipeline produces sRGB. The native preview handed those numbers
//! to the panel untouched — `gpu_processing.rs` asks for a non-sRGB swapchain
//! format and `display.wgsl` returns what it sampled — which is correct only if
//! the panel *is* sRGB. On a wide-gamut display it is not: the same numbers
//! drive more saturated primaries, so everything came out over-saturated, and
//! no amount of looking at it would say so, because there was nothing beside it
//! to compare against.
//!
//! There was, though. The crop view goes out as a JPEG in an HTML `<img>`,
//! which WebView2 colour-manages properly, so the two views of the same photo
//! disagreed. An audit measured the difference and found it was exactly this
//! monitor's gamut conversion — mean error 0.5 of 255 against a matrix derived
//! from the installed profile, against 3.5 without it.
//!
//! WHAT THIS DOES
//!
//! Reads the ICC profile the operating system has for the display and works out
//! the matrix from sRGB to that display's primaries, so the shader can convert
//! before presenting.
//!
//! It must follow the display and not the machine: a laptop panel and an
//! external monitor have different profiles, and a window dragged between them
//! changes which one applies. So the profile is resolved per window, from the
//! monitor that window is on, and re-resolved when it moves.
//!
//! WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT
//!
//! Not a full ICC transform. The profile's tone curves are read and ignored:
//! the audit found that applying them was a *worse* match than the primaries
//! with a plain sRGB curve, which is what Windows itself appears to do for this
//! class of profile. Matching the rest of the system matters more here than
//! matching the specification, and claiming more than was measured would be
//! worse than doing less.
//!
//! Not a way to make the old picture come back either. The old picture was
//! wrong. Anything that restored it — saturation, a different matrix — would be
//! inventing colour to match a bug.
