//! White balance saved before RapidRAW 1.6.5, read in 1.6.5's units.
//!
//! WHAT CHANGED
//!
//! From 26.37.2 until the 1.6.5 merge, Temperature and Tint ran through our own
//! `dt_white_balance` in `modules.wgsl`. Each slider named an illuminant: the
//! temperature, divided by 25, went through `6500 * exp(t * 0.28)` onto the
//! daylight locus, the tint (divided by 100) moved its `y` by `n * 0.05`, and
//! the picture was adapted from that illuminant to D65 in Bradford cone space.
//!
//! RapidRAW 1.6.5 shipped its own engine and we took it (see `modules.wgsl`).
//! Its sliders mean something else: 1.5 mired and 1.5 tint units per step away
//! from the camera's as-shot white balance, with an optional absolute
//! `whiteBalance` in kelvin beside them. The same number now asks for a
//! different correction. Cooling by 50 was 115 mired and is now 75, and a tint
//! step is close to three times as strong. Left alone, every photo whose white
//! balance was touched would change colour on the first open after the update.
//!
//! WHICH EDITS ARE OLD
//!
//! Every adjustments object the app writes since 1.6.5 carries a `whiteBalance`
//! key, null when the sliders are relative (their `INITIAL_ADJUSTMENTS` has it).
//! An edit without the key was saved before the merge. That is the whole test,
//! and once a converted edit is saved with the key it is never converted again.
//!
//! WHERE, WITHOUT A LINE OF THEIRS
//!
//! The obvious places are a line at the top of their
//! `get_all_adjustments_from_json` and one in their `load_metadata`. The anchor
//! check refused both: those files have no allowance left, and an allowance
//! does not go up for a feature. So everything happens from our side:
//!
//! - **The editor.** `src/argentum/wbLegacy.ts` sees every `load_metadata`
//!   answer before their code does and, when the edit is old, swaps in
//!   `upgraded` and saves it through their `save_metadata_and_update_thumbnail`.
//!   Their editor never holds an old edit, so it can never save one back with
//!   the new key and the old numbers, which would fix the wrong colour for good.
//! - **Everything else.** When the library lists a folder, `find_old` reports
//!   the old edits in it, converted, and the frontend saves each the same way,
//!   which also redraws its thumbnail. Batch exports read the saved file.
//! - **Presets**, once, at start-up.
//!
//! Not covered: a headless export from the command line of a photo whose folder
//! has never been listed since the update.
//!
//! HOW
//!
//! Exactly, not by curve fitting. The old adaptation took the colour of its
//! illuminant to white, which is what auto white balance asks of their engine
//! too: `auto_wb::removing_illuminant` hands the illuminant to their
//! `pick_white_balance` and gets back the white balance that makes the same
//! correction, in their units.
//! The tests below check the gains agree.
//!
//! Relative when it fits on their sliders, absolute when it does not: a
//! relative edit keeps meaning "this much warmer than the camera" when it is
//! copied to another photo, which is what it meant before.
//!
//! WHAT THIS DOES NOT REPRODUCE
//!
//! The old shader decoded the RAW a second time before adapting and clipped at
//! white on the way back, so its correction was weaker than its own maths said
//! (about three quarters of it in the midtones) and every highlight above white
//! was lost whenever the sliders were off zero. That was a bug. This converts
//! what the sliders asked for, so an old edit comes back slightly stronger, and
//! with its highlights.
