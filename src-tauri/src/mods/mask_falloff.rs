//! How a linear or radial mask fades out.
//!
//! WHY
//!
//! RapidRAW draws both as a straight ramp clamped to 0..1. The clamp leaves a
//! corner where the ramp meets full strength and another where it meets none,
//! and the eye reads a corner in a smooth gradient as a faint line (a Mach
//! band). A graduated sky showed two edges, one at each outer handle, so the
//! mask looked like a band with sides rather than a fade.
//!
//! LINEAR: smoothstep between the two lines
//!
//! The mask's two outer lines (`range` either side of its centre line) are
//! where the effect is full and where it has gone, and Argentum draws them as
//! exactly that (`src/argentum/LinearMask.tsx`). So the curve has to be 100% on
//! one and 0% on the other, and level at both, so neither shows as a line.
//! Smoothstep is that curve.
//!
//! darktable's gradient (`0.5 + 0.5 * erf(d / compression)`) was tried first
//! and dropped: it is 92% and 8% at its lines and carries on past them, so the
//! lines stopped meaning where the fade starts and ends.
//!
//! RADIAL: the same curve, across the feather
//!
//! The curve RapidRAW already gives a feathered brush in `mask_generation.rs`,
//! so a radial mask and a brush stroke fade alike. darktable's ellipse
//! (`f * f`) keeps a corner at the inner edge, so it was not taken. Exactly 1
//! inside and 0 outside the feather, as before; only the shape between changes.
