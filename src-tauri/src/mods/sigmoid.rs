//! darktable's sigmoid tone mapping.
//!
//! Harvested from darktable `src/iop/sigmoid.c`, function
//! `_generalized_loglogistic_sigmoid` and the parameter derivation inside
//! `commit_params`.
//!
//! WHY
//!
//! Measured across 34 photos from 17 shoots, our rendering sits at **69% of
//! darktable's brightness**, on every single one. darktable's chain is
//!
//! ```text
//! rawprepare temperature highlights flip exposure colorin
//! channelmixerrgb sigmoid finalscale colorout gamma
//! ```
//!
//! where ours is gamma 2.38 with a 1.28 contrast boost and nothing else. The
//! missing pieces are an exposure lift and this curve. Photos come out
//! dark and flat as a result — the problem that started this.
//!
//! WHAT IT IS
//!
//! A log-logistic curve modelling film and paper response, with three
//! constraints: scene black maps to display black, scene middle grey to a fixed
//! output level, and scene infinity to display white. Compared to a plain
//! gamma it holds highlights instead of clipping them, which is most of why
//! darktable's rendering looks less harsh.
//!
//! This is a straight port. The parameters are derived exactly as darktable
//! derives them, including the finite-difference slope matching, rather than
//! approximated — copying the reasoning and not just the constants, which is
//! the lesson DEC-46 recorded the hard way.

// Nothing in the app calls this yet.
//
// darktable's sigmoid, harvested and shipped as the tone curve in 2026.37.8,
// then reverted in 2026.37.9 — it had been built against a single frame and was
// compensating for the sRAW levels bug, which was found straight afterwards.
// The maths was never the problem and is kept for "Filmic tone mapping" on the
// roadmap. Its own tests exercise it; the binary does not.
