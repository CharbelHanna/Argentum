//! Highlight recovery: putting colour back where a channel clipped.
//!
//! WHAT THE PROBLEM ACTUALLY IS
//!
//! A sensor photosite saturates. Past that point it counts no more light and
//! reports its ceiling, and the ceiling is per channel — the three channels do
//! not reach it together, because the scene is not neutral and because the
//! camera's own white balance means green saturates long before red and blue in
//! daylight. So a bright area does not go white. It goes *wrong*: green pins to
//! its ceiling while red and blue keep climbing, white balance then multiplies
//! red and blue by nearly two, and a white dress in sun comes out magenta, or a
//! sunset comes out with a hard cyan edge where the sky stopped being data.
//!
//! Recovery is the observation that a pixel with one clipped channel and two
//! good ones is not lost. The two that survived say what colour it was and
//! roughly how bright; the missing one can be estimated rather than left at its
//! ceiling. A pixel with all three clipped is genuinely gone, and no amount of
//! arithmetic invents it — the honest thing there is a smooth white, not a
//! hallucination.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS NOT THE HIGHLIGHTS SLIDER
//!
//! RapidRAW has one, in `shader.wgsl`. It is a tone adjustment: it moves detail
//! that is still in the file. It cannot help here, because the problem is
//! detail that is *not* in the file — and it runs after demosaic, by which
//! point a clipped green has already been smeared across its neighbours.
//!
//! WHY MEASUREMENT COMES FIRST
//!
//! Camera profiles were built on the reasoning that they would close the gap
//! against darktable. They could not, and one measurement afterwards said so.
//! So recovery was built only after measuring how much of a real photo is
//! clipped, and how much of that is *recoverable* — one or two channels gone,
//! not all three. That number is the ceiling on what any recovery can be
//! worth. The survey that measured it is in git history (before 26.44).

// ============================================================================
// WHAT IS GONE COMES OUT WHITE
// ============================================================================

/// Make sure what the sensor lost entirely comes out white, not magenta.
///
/// WHY THIS IS NOT PART OF RECOVERY
///
/// Recovery rebuilds a channel from the ones that survived. Where every
/// channel clipped there is nothing left to rebuild from, and `rebuild` rightly
/// refuses to invent one. But leaving those photosites alone is not neutral:
/// they all sit at their ceiling, white balance multiplies red and blue by two
/// or more, and the camera matrix turns that into flat magenta. A blown window
/// behind a portrait came out pink.
///
/// Until 2026-09-23 that was hidden by a compression pass in
/// `raw_processing.rs` that desaturated everything above white. RapidRAW
/// removed it (85bf424a) and covered the gap with a post-demosaic colour
/// correction (40cfa3df). Argentum took the removal and declined the
/// correction, because it would stack on this module's recovery — and from
/// then on nothing did the job. This is the job, done where the evidence is:
/// in the CFA before demosaic, where "every photosite of this block is at its
/// ceiling" is a measurement rather than a guess made from a colour.
///
/// TWO CASES, AND NEITHER LEAVES A CAST
///
/// `rebuilt` says whether `recover` was in charge of this photo.
///
/// - It was: a block with every channel gone is set neutral at the brightest
///   level any of its photosites recorded, so a blown core is never darker
///   than the reconstructed edge around it. Blocks recovery rebuilt keep their
///   brightness and fade from their reconstructed colour, just over the
///   clipping point, to neutral half a stop above it. Recovery recovers light;
///   past the clip, the colour it would give that light is a guess.
/// - It was not — switched off, or no highlight colour to learn from: this is
///   plain clipping, which is what every RAW developer does without
///   reconstruction. In each block with a clipped channel, every photosite is
///   capped where the first channel stops being data. The clipped area goes
///   flat white instead of coloured, and nothing outside it changes.
///
/// Neutral means neutral *after white balance*, the only place it matters.
/// rawler multiplies each channel by its coefficient and then applies a matrix
/// whose rows sum to one, so equal white-balanced values come out as equal RGB.
/// `wb` has to be the coefficients rawler will actually develop with.
///
/// A block with nothing clipped is never touched, and a photo with nothing
/// clipped keeps its integer buffer exactly as decoded.
///
/// `ceilings` are the ones `recover` was given: judged on the photo as decoded,
/// not on what recovery made of it.

// ============================================================================
// THE SETTING
// ============================================================================
//
// WHY IT IS A SETTING AND NOT A SLIDER
//
// Neither Lightroom nor darktable gives highlight recovery an amount. Lightroom
// has no control at all — it happens, always, as part of reading the file.
// darktable and RawTherapee give you a *method* to choose between and a switch
// to turn it off, because there is nothing continuous to dial: a channel is
// either being reconstructed or it is being left at its ceiling.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT PER PHOTO
//
// Because this runs while the RAW is decoded, and a per-photo setting that
// changes the decode has to re-read the file every time it is flipped. Camera
// profiles were built that way first and it took four attempts and a rewrite
// onto the GPU before switching one stopped breaking something. This cannot go
// on the GPU — it has to happen before demosaic, on the mosaic itself — so
// instead it does not pretend to be instant: it is a preference, and it applies
// to the next photo opened.
