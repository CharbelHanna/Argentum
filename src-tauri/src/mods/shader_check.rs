//! Does the shader actually compile? Ours.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS
//!
//! WGSL is compiled when the app runs, not when it is built. So a mistake in it
//! passes `cargo build`, passes `cargo test`, passes the production build, and
//! then every photo opens black — which is exactly what happened,
//! twice in one evening. There was nothing between writing a bad line and
//! seeing a black picture with "Validation Error" in the log and no detail.
//!
//! naga is the compiler wgpu already uses, and it is reachable through wgpu, so
//! this runs it over the same two files joined the same way `gpu_processing.rs`
//! joins them. A syntax error or a type error now fails a test with the line
//! number instead of blanking the app.
//!
//! It does not need a GPU and takes milliseconds.

/// The shader source, exactly as `gpu_processing.rs` assembles it.
///
/// Not a second copy of the concatenation: it is the same constant the renderer
/// compiles. This file used to hold its own `concat!` of the same two includes,
/// which was fine until a third caller appeared and the whole point of the check
/// (that the text under test is the text that runs) stopped being guaranteed by
/// anything but everyone remembering.
