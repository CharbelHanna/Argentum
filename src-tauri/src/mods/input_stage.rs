//! Argentum's GPU work on the input, before RapidRAW's shader runs. One anchor.
//!
//! `gpu_processing.rs` calls `run` once per render, after it has the input
//! texture and before its own passes, and renders whatever comes back - or
//! its own texture, untouched, when `None` does. That call is the whole
//! upstream cost of every multi-pass tool Argentum will add: sharpening now,
//! and the next thing that needs whole-image passes rather than one pixel at a
//! time (denoise, diffuse or sharpen) goes in here, not in another line of
//! theirs. See `modules.wgsl` for the per-pixel stages, which are the same
//! idea one level down. AK's decision, 2026-10-10.
//!
//! ORDER IS THE CONTRACT
//!
//! Tools run top to bottom as written in `run`, each on the previous one's
//! output. Sharpening is first because capture sharpening undoes the lens; a
//! denoiser would go before it, so it is not sharpening the noise.
