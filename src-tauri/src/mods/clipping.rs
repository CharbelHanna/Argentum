//! Which clipping view the photo is being shown in. Ours.
//!
//! RapidRAW has one clipping warning: any channel over the line goes red, any
//! pixel under it goes blue. That answers "is something clipped" and not the
//! question you ask next, which is *what* clipped — because a highlight where
//! only red has gone is recoverable and one where all three have gone is not.
//!
//! So the button cycles rather than toggles: off, all channels, then red, green
//! and blue on their own.
//!
//! Three more modes are not on that cycle because they are *held*, not chosen:
//! Ctrl while dragging Whites or Blacks empties the picture to black or white
//! and shows only what is being blown or crushed, which is how a white point
//! and a black point are actually set. Lightroom does this with Alt; Alt and
//! Shift on a slider here already mean fine adjustment, so it is Ctrl. With a
//! film look on, what the photo loses on its way into the look shows too: a
//! faded look never prints black or white, so the screen alone would show
//! nothing (`ag_point_view` in modules.wgsl). The third is the sharpening
//! mask, held from the Sharpening card the same way.
//!
//! WHY NOT ONE VIEW WITH THE CHANNELS COLOUR-CODED
//!
//! That was the first version, and it was better on paper: one look tells you
//! whether a highlight is savable, with no remembering. It was also misread
//! within seconds of being shown, because in the first mode red already means
//! *blown highlight* and in that one it would have meant *the red channel*.
//! Two meanings on one button. Red is blown and blue is crushed in every mode
//! here, and which channel you are looking at is the thing the button says.
//!
//! WHY THE FIELD IS STILL CALLED `showClipping`
//!
//! Because it is theirs, and it is stored per photo alongside every other
//! adjustment. Their button reads it as a truthy value and highlights when it is
//! set, which a mode number satisfies without them knowing anything about modes.
//! Adding a second field of our own would have meant a new key in the saved
//! adjustments — and every key there is part of the thumbnail cache hash, so a
//! new one rebuilds the user's whole library once for nothing.

// The mode constants are a contract with two things Rust cannot see: the WGSL
// in shaders/modules.wgsl, which compares against the same numbers, and the
// frontend, which cycles through them. Naming them here is what keeps those
// three in step, so they are not dead — they are the definition.
