//! How long an editor render may take: the budgets
//! `sharpen_gpu::tests::where_the_time_goes` holds every row to. Ours.
//!
//! WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM
//!
//! One laptop: Intel Core Ultra 9 288V with its Arc 140V graphics, driver
//! 32.0.101.6042, on mains power. Measured on 2026-10-21 with main at
//! 4d559684, in the test profile (plain `cargo test`, no `--release`).
//!
//! The test runs every row three times, each round on a device of its own,
//! and keeps the fastest: noise only ever adds time, and a slowdown slows all
//! three. Ten runs of the test gave each row's median and slowest, and its
//! budget is the largest of 1.5 x the median, the median + 5 ms and 1.2 x the
//! slowest, rounded up to a whole ms. The last term is for a row that takes
//! one of two speeds: DirectX 12's first mask view at 6960 px is 119 ms in
//! most runs and 175 in some.
//!
//! A slower GPU fails them, so the test stays `#[ignore]`d and is run by hand
//! on that laptop before every release (docs/RELEASING.md). Anywhere else,
//! `AG_SPEED_BUDGETS=report` prints the rows over budget without failing.
//!
//! NEVER WORSE
//!
//! A row over its budget is a slowdown to fix, not a number to raise. When a
//! change makes a row faster, measure again and lower its budget: the test
//! prints what it measured as lines of this table.
