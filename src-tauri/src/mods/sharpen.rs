//! Sharpening: RawTherapee's capture sharpening and darktable's sharpen, with
//! RawTherapee's contrast mask deciding where either lands. Ours.
//!
//! WHAT IT REPLACES
//!
//! RapidRAW's Sharpness slider sizes its blur from the photo's short edge
//! (`min(w, h) / 1080`), so the radius grows with the sensor: about 2 px on a
//! 24 MP file, 3 px at 45 MP. Lens and sensor blur is under a pixel whatever
//! the megapixels, so it behaved like local contrast with halos. It also cut
//! the dark side of every edge to a tenth, gated out texture under about 2%
//! contrast, smoothed diagonal edges inside the sharpener, and read its fine
//! taps from the image before noise reduction. It stays in the shader, unused
//! unless an old edit still has a value, and its slider is hidden from Details
//! - see `src/argentum/Sharpening.tsx`.
//!
//! WHAT IT IS
//!
//! Three harvested pieces, run on the GPU before their shader - see
//! `shaders/sharpen.wgsl` for the maths and `sharpen_gpu.rs` for the passes:
//!
//! - **Capture sharpening**, RawTherapee `rtengine/capturesharpening.cc`
//!   @ c6d04960e14fed89e531cbbdf680021d131b4685. Richardson-Lucy deconvolution
//!   of the luminance with a gaussian PSF: it undoes blur rather than adding
//!   edge contrast. RAW only, as in RawTherapee. Its radius can be read from
//!   the RAW itself - `calc_radius_bayer` and `calc_radius_xtrans` below.
//! - **Sharpen**, darktable `src/iop/sharpen.c` @ 39df8424e67b99c870fc346ea8f5f241a4620575.
//!   The classic unsharp mask on L, with darktable's threshold, for output and
//!   creative sharpening.
//! - **The contrast mask**, RawTherapee `rtengine/rt_algo.cc`
//!   @ 1c2b3f33772eaf491b7bd4d66323ac36d13aa344. A sigmoid on local contrast,
//!   blurred, so flat areas - sky, skin, noise - are left alone. Its threshold
//!   can be found automatically from the flattest part of the photo -
//!   `auto_contrast` below. The mask view shows it.
//!
//! RADII ARE IN FULL-RESOLUTION PIXELS
//!
//! The user's radius means the same thing at every zoom: the GPU stage scales
//! it by how many render pixels there are per full-resolution pixel, as
//! darktable scales by `roi_in->scale` and RawTherapee divides by its preview
//! scale. So it is exact at 100%, and an approximation at fit-to-screen - where
//! capture sharpening's effect is genuinely below one screen pixel and is
//! skipped. Lightroom asks you to judge sharpening at 1:1 for the same reason.
