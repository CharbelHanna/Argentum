//! Applying a camera profile after the decode instead of during it.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS
//!
//! The profile used to be applied while the RAW was decoded, by substituting
//! its matrix for rawler's. That is the natural place for it and it does not
//! work here, for a reason that has nothing to do with colour: every other
//! adjustment in this app is applied on the GPU, per frame, so the app has no
//! notion of a setting that needs the file read again. Four attempts to bolt
//! one on each broke something else — a black flash on every switch, a
//! debounced save racing the choice and reverting it, a preview worker finding
//! no image because the decode had cleared it.
//!
//! So: decode once, normally, with rawler's own matrix. Then apply the
//! *difference* between that matrix and the profile's, where every other
//! adjustment already happens. Same arithmetic, different place, and switching
//! becomes instant because nothing has to be read again.
//!
//! THE DIFFERENCE
//!
//! The decode leaves scene-linear sRGB, having applied
//!
//! ```text
//! builtin = pinv(normalize(builtin_xyz2cam · sRGB→XYZ))
//! ```
//!
//! and what we want applied is the same expression with the profile's matrix.
//! Going from one to the other is
//!
//! ```text
//! correction = wanted · inv(builtin)
//! ```
//!
//! which is a single 3x3 on already-decoded pixels. Identity when no profile is
//! chosen, so a photo without one is untouched — not approximately untouched,
//! exactly: the matrix is the identity and the shader multiplies by it.

/// A worker decoding a second photo between another worker's decode and render
/// handed that render the wrong matrix, and the correction inverted a transform
/// that was never applied. Silent, and wrong in colour rather than behaviour.
///
/// WHY IT IS NOT KEYED BY CAMERA EITHER
///
/// That was the second attempt: the matrix belongs to the body, not the frame.
/// True of a CR2, where rawler reads it from its own camera table; false of a
/// DNG, which carries its own. One camera, several matrices.
///
/// WHY THE RENDER IS TOLD WHICH PHOTO IT IS, RATHER THAN GUESSING
///
/// The third attempt inferred it: the last photo decoded on this thread, and
/// failing that whatever the editor had open. It reads well and it is guesswork.
/// Export of the *open* photo reuses the editor's pixels and never decodes, so
/// a worker that decoded something else in a previous job answered with that
/// photo's path and beat the correct fallback. An audit reproduced it.
///
/// So a render says what it is rendering. `rendering()` returns a guard that
/// holds the path for as long as the render lasts and clears it on the way out,
/// which is the one arrangement that cannot go stale: it is tied to a scope
/// rather than to the history of a thread.
///
/// It costs two lines in their files, at the two places a render begins without
/// a decode of its own — the preview worker and the export worker. That is a
/// deliberate exception to the anchor rule, taken because the alternative was a
/// heuristic that is wrong in a case a person would hit.
/// One photo's built-in matrix, and its camera (maker, model) once the decode
/// has said, remembered against the photo they came from; and what an edit made
/// the DNG way needs for its camera colour (mods/dng_colour.rs).
