//! The GPU passes behind `sharpen.rs`. Ours.
//!
//! Takes the texture RapidRAW's shader is about to read, and returns a
//! sharpened copy of it - or `None` when there is nothing to do, in which case
//! their texture is used exactly as it was.
//!
//! TILES
//!
//! The image is walked in 1024 px tiles with a 64 px border, and every scratch
//! buffer is one bordered tile. RawTherapee does the same with 32 px tiles and
//! a border of 5 to 8, because Richardson-Lucy converges locally: twenty
//! iterations of a sigma-1 kernel do not carry an edge's influence anywhere
//! near 64 px. Tiling keeps the scratch at 32 MB whether the photo is 2 MP or
//! 100 MP; only the output is full size, and that is the texture their shader
//! would otherwise have read.
//!
//! WHEN IT RUNS
//!
//! Only when its inputs change. The result is kept with everything that went
//! into it - the picture, the settings, the scale - and handed back as is
//! while those match, so dragging Exposure costs nothing here. Dragging a
//! sharpening slider recomputes, and while their render has a region of
//! interest (zoomed in, mid-drag) only that region and a margin is sharpened;
//! the rest is copied across untouched.
//!
//! Zoomed in, the editor alternates between two pictures: a smaller copy of
//! the photo while something moves, and the photo itself once it stops. Two
//! results are kept, one of each, so neither undoes the other. And the kept
//! result remembers which part of it is sharpened: panning sharpens only the
//! strip that comes into view, not the whole view again every frame - which
//! made dragging the photo around at 100% several times slower.
//!
//! ON OPENGL
//!
//! RapidRAW offers OpenGL as a processing backend, and falls back to it on
//! its own after a crash during start-up. Two things differ there, both found
//! on AK's machine on 2026-10-10:
//!
//! - A texture with one layer cannot be viewed as an array, so every layered
//!   texture here has at least two (their mask array does the same).
//! - The GL context is one lock for the whole device, and wgpu panics in any
//!   thread that waits more than a second for it - "Could not lock adapter
//!   context. This is most-likely a deadlock." A blocking poll holds it until
//!   the GPU is done, so seconds of deconvolution queued at once meant the next
//!   thread to want the context crashed, and with it their preview worker.
//!   On GL the work goes in small submissions, each waited for without the
//!   lock held for long (`wait_briefly`), so nobody waits behind more than one.
//!
//! WHICH TEXTURE IT WRITES
//!
//! `Target::Kept` reuses one texture between calls. That is only safe where
//! calls cannot overlap - inside `process_and_get_dynamic_image`, which holds
//! RapidRAW's processor lock for the whole render. Anything outside that lock
//! (the 16-bit export) asks for `Target::Fresh`, and gets a texture of its own
//! that dies with the render.
