//! The camera profile library: where `.dcp` files live, and which one a photo gets.
//!
//! WHY IMPORTED RATHER THAN BUNDLED
//!
//! The obvious move is to ship a folder of profiles so everything works out of
//! the box. It is not available to us. RawTherapee's collection — the best free
//! one — is bundled there with the individual authors' permission, not under a
//! blanket licence, so redistributing it from this project would be assuming a
//! right nobody granted. Adobe's, which come with the free DNG Converter, are
//! Adobe's.
//!
//! So Argentum reads profiles and does not ship them. The user points at a file
//! once; it is copied into the library and matched automatically from then on.
//! That also happens to be the only design that works for cameras nobody here
//! owns, which is most of them.
//!
//! MATCHING
//!
//! A profile names the body it was made for in `UniqueCameraModel`, and the
//! photo names its own in EXIF. Both are messy in the same ways — "Canon EOS 5D
//! Mark II" against "Canon Canon EOS 5D Mark II" against "EOS 5D Mark II" — so
//! comparison is done on a normalised form rather than exactly. A wrong match
//! is worse than none, so it is the *whole* normalised name that has to agree.
//!
//! The filename is used only as a fallback, for profiles that leave
//! `UniqueCameraModel` empty. What the file is called is not evidence.
