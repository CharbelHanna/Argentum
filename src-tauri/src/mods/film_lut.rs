//! What a film look that comes with the app is fed. Ours.
//!
//! THE LUTS
//!
//! The film looks (`resources/film_luts`) are spektrafilm LUTs, which RapidRAW
//! ships and applies in place of the rendering: their scene-referred path in
//! shader.wgsl encodes the scene-linear picture with the V-Log curve and looks
//! it up. Each file names its input in its header, "Panasonic V-Log". In
//! spektrafilm's LUT creator that is the V-Log curve over V-Gamut primaries
//! (`spektrafilm_lut_creator/color_spaces.py` @ 3bb2c2d2, the 0.3.4 the LUTs
//! were made with: `"Panasonic V-Log", "V-Gamut", "V-Log"`), the code values
//! decoded and handed to the film as V-Gamut RGB.
//!
//! WHAT RAPIDRAW FEEDS THEM
//!
//! The curve over Argentum's working RGB, which is linear sRGB. V-Gamut's
//! primaries lie far outside sRGB's, so every colour reaches the film as a
//! stronger one: 1.4 to 1.6 times the chroma (OkLab) for skin, sky and
//! foliage, skin turned 11 degrees toward red and blues 15 toward cyan.
//!
//! It also feeds them a RAW at the exposure the sensor left it, without the
//! camera's exposure offset that DNG Standard and Linear add (dng_standard.rs).
//! The film look replaces the rendering whole, so that offset, which rides in
//! the rendering's curve, never reached it, and every RAW went to the film a
//! fraction of a stop dark. spektrafilm takes linear 0.18 as middle grey for a
//! V-Log input (no exposure gain since 0.3.4, its commit 3bb2c2d2 "fix: vlog
//! midgray exposure"), and the offset is what puts a RAW's middle grey there.
//!
//! WHAT THIS FEEDS THEM
//!
//! What the file declares: the picture converted to V-Gamut before the curve
//! (`ag_film_lut_input` in modules.wgsl), and, for a RAW in DNG Standard or
//! Linear, at the offset its rendering carries, read back from the edit's own
//! curve (`dng_standard::offset_of`). The rendering's tone curve stays out: the
//! film's own curve is the rendering. Their curve and lookup are untouched.
//!
//! An enlargement (mods/super_resolution.rs) is an ordinary image at its RAW's
//! exposure, with no rendering of its own, so its edit carries the offset as a
//! number, `agLutExposureEv`.
//!
//! WHICH EDITS
//!
//! An edit that put a film look on before this keeps its look. A LUT is fed
//! what its file declares when the edit carries `"agLutDeclaredInput": true`,
//! which the Looks tab writes whenever it puts a LUT on or previews one
//! (src/argentum/looks/filmLookInput.ts), and Copy settings carries with the
//! LUT. Their Looks swatches (`generate_lut_previews`) show a LUT as it goes
//! on now. Only the scene-referred path reads it; a LUT of the user's goes
//! after the rendering, as before.
