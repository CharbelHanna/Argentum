//! Everything Argentum does when the app starts. One anchor.
//!
//! `lib.rs` calls `init` once, and that call is the whole upstream cost of any
//! startup work we ever add. It replaced a direct call to the thumbnail cache
//! check for exactly that reason: the second thing that needed to happen at
//! startup would otherwise have been a second line of their file.
//!
//! It takes the app handle rather than a path because different things want
//! different directories, and resolving them here keeps that decision on our
//! side. It matters: the thumbnail check works on the *cache* directory, which
//! is disposable by definition, while imported camera profiles are the user's
//! own files and must not live somewhere a cleaner may empty.
