//! Canon sRAW / mRAW black and white levels, set the way rawspeed sets them.
//!
//! THE BUG
//!
//! Canon's small-RAW formats do not store sensor data. They store the picture as
//! luma and chroma, already black-subtracted and already white-balanced by the
//! camera. rawler converts that back to RGB correctly — its arithmetic matches
//! dcraw and rawspeed line for line — and then treats the result like ordinary
//! sensor data: it subtracts the sensor black level (1023 on a 5D Mark II) and
//! takes a white level from its camera table (64948) rather than from the file.
//!
//! Neither is right for this format. rawspeed, which darktable uses, is explicit
//! about it (`Cr2Decoder::decodeMetaDataInternal`): for sRAW the black level is
//! zero and the white point is the file's specular white shifted up two bits,
//! because the conversion scales the data up by four.
//!
//! WHY IT LOOKED LIKE A COLOUR PROBLEM
//!
//! Before white balance, red sits at roughly half of green in this data — the
//! stored coefficients that undo the camera's balance are `[545, 1170, 721]`.
//! Subtracting the same 1023 from every channel therefore takes about 18% off
//! red and 8% off green. White balance then scales that gap up, and the camera
//! matrix, which has large off-diagonal terms for Canon, amplifies it again.
//! Measured on one sRAW file, linear, against darktable at the same stage:
//!
//! ```text
//!                    R/G      B/G
//! darktable         0.97     1.03
//! rawler            0.53     0.80
//! ```
//!
//! It is also the source of the crushed shadows: the darkest sRAW values sit at
//! 100–300 counts, so subtracting 1023 sends them below zero, where they clamp.
//! On a backlit frame that was 40% of the picture, pure black before any tool
//! could touch it. Every downstream fix that tried to compensate — the D50/D65
//! matrix correction, the exposure experiments, the tone curves — was fighting
//! this one subtraction.
//!
//! GENERAL, NOT PER CAMERA
//!
//! The trigger is the format, not the model: three channels straight out of the
//! decoder in a Canon file. The white level is read from the file itself, using
//! Canon's own ColorData layout — the same version table rawspeed and rawler
//! both carry, which covers every body that shoots sRAW. Nothing here names a
//! camera. If the layout is not understood the black level is still zeroed,
//! because that part does not depend on the layout at all, and rawler's white
//! level is kept.
//!
//! WHY HERE AND NOT IN RAWLER
//!
//! rawler is an upstream dependency pulled by git; patching it would mean
//! carrying a fork of a fork. Overriding two public fields on the decoded image
//! costs one line in `raw_processing.rs` and is trivially removable if the fix
//! lands upstream.
//!
//! A SECOND sRAW PROBLEM, WHICH IS NOT OURS
//!
//! rawler's CR2 decoder can be asked for a *dummy* image: allocated, never
//! filled, so the caller can read its dimensions without paying for a decode.
//! RapidRAW asks for one to size thumbnails. For sRAW the decoder hands that
//! uninitialised buffer to `convert_to_rgb` regardless, and `pixels_mut()`
//! asserts on exactly that — so every sRAW thumbnail died in a dev build, four
//! at a time, while release was fine because the assertion is compiled out.
//!
//! The fix is `debug-assertions = false` for dependencies in
//! `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, beside the `opt-level = 3` that is already there:
//! dependencies in this project are built as release code, and asserting inside
//! them contradicts that. It silences a real bug in rawler rather than fixing
//! it, which is the honest description — the bug is theirs, the dimensions it
//! returns are right, and the alternative is patching their decoder.
