//! Auto white balance for a photo that is not open.
//!
//! Auto measures the photo it is pressed on (`commands::detect_auto_white_balance`,
//! on the editor's picture). A paste carries that answer to other photos, where
//! it is the wrong light, so each of them is measured here instead
//! (argentum/autoWhiteBalance.ts). The picture is the one the editor would
//! measure: the photo decoded as for an export, its inpainted areas composited
//! and its geometry applied, as Restore & Enlarge loads one
//! (super_resolution.rs `load_source`), through `build_full_warped_image`, which
//! is what the open photo's measurement reads.
