//! Automatic white balance — illuminant detection from the image itself.
//!
//! Harvested from darktable `src/iop/channelmixerrgb.c` @ `98a9ade9`,
//! function `_auto_detect_WB()`. Reference copy kept at
//! `docs/harvest/dt_auto_detect_wb.c`.
//!
//! Based on:
//!   - *A Fast White Balance Algorithm Based on Pixel Greyness* —
//!     Ba Thai, Guang Deng, Robert Ross
//!   - *Edge-Based Color Constancy* —
//!     Joost van de Weijer, Theo Gevers, Arjan Gijsenij
//!
//! The idea: shift every pixel's chromaticity so the D50 white point sits at
//! the origin, then take a weighted average of what's left. Whatever the average
//! comes out as is the scene's illuminant — the colour cast we need to remove.
//!
//! Two weightings:
//!   - **Surfaces** weights each patch by the variance of both chroma channels
//!     times their covariance. That deliberately *discards* flat patches, which
//!     say nothing about the illuminant, and uncorrelated ones, which are noise
//!     or chromatic aberration rather than real surfaces. What survives is
//!     genuinely coloured texture.
//!   - **Edges** weights by edge strength instead — the grey-edge hypothesis,
//!     that image derivatives average to neutral. Holds up better when one
//!     colour dominates the frame and grey-world falls apart.
