//! Argentum's own preferences file, with more than one thing in it. Ours.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS
//!
//! `argentum-processing.json` sits beside the profile library because it is
//! ours: one small file of our own rather than keys in their settings, which
//! would be lines of theirs and a merge conflict every time upstream touches
//! that file.
//!
//! It held exactly one key, and the code that wrote it did this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let text = serde_json::to_string_pretty(&json!({ "highlightRecovery": on }))?;
//! std::fs::write(settings_path(library), text)
//! ```
//!
//! Which is correct for one setting and silently destroys every other one. The
//! second preference Argentum saved would have erased the first, and the way it
//! showed up would be a user reporting that highlight recovery keeps turning
//! itself back on — a bug with no obvious connection to the export settings that
//! caused it.
//!
//! So reading and writing go through here: load the object, change one key, put
//! it back. Nothing else in the file is touched.
//!
//! A missing, empty or corrupt file reads as "no value" rather than an error;
//! a corrupt one is copied aside first (mods/salvage.rs).
//! The preference is a convenience; it is not worth failing a startup over, and
//! every caller has a sensible default already.
