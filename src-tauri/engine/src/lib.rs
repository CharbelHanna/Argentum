//! Argentum's engine.
//!
//! Tools from darktable, RawTherapee, RapidRAW, RAWmakase and Argentum, each
//! one file in `src/tools/` and one line in `registry.rs`, run in order by a
//! pipeline that keeps every tool's result. `contract.rs` holds every type
//! the interface sees, and `engine.rs` the calls it makes. See README.md for
//! the contract and how to add a tool.
//!
//! A library of its own: it builds and tests from its folder without
//! building the app, and the app does not use it yet.
