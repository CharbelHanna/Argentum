//! Contrast, highlights, shadows, whites and blacks: RapidRAW's, as the app
//! runs them.
//!
//! Each works on luminance and keeps colour: a pixel is scaled by how far
//! its luminance moved. Highlights, shadows, whites and blacks move the light
//! a pixel sits in rather than its texture - RapidRAW's guided filter on log
//! luminance says which is which - and put the texture back on top, so
//! lifting the shadows does not flatten them. Contrast is an S-curve around
//! middle grey, leaving values above white alone.
//!
//! From the app @ c786c146: `apply_tonal_adjustments`,
//! `apply_highlights_adjustment`, `shape_detail` and `sample_gf_tex` in
//! `src-tauri/src/shaders/shader.wgsl` - the first two since with RapidRAW
//! 1.6.7's Highlights fix (faf039cf) and Whites range (9fc41e4a), as the app
//! took them - and the part of its `main` that measures each pixel's detail,
//! in `tone.wgsl`, run in the pixel pass; the sliders' scale (`SCALES` in
//! `src-tauri/src/image_processing.rs`). The settings are the app's slider
//! values, -100 to 100.
//!
//! The detail is measured as the app measures it: the guided filter of the
//! pixel pass's input, before exposure and white balance, kept on the GPU
//! for as long as that input is the same. The app filters its input before
//! capture sharpening; this engine after it.
