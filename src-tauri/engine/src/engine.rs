//! The engine as the interface uses it: list the sections and tools, open a
//! photo, change its edit, look at part of it. Step 2 makes each of these a Tauri command
//! and forwards the events.
//!
//! `apply` and `view` return a ticket at once and the render happens on a
//! thread of its own. Renders are latest-wins: a newer ticket replaces any
//! render still waiting, and one already running gives up at the next step
//! boundary. A finished render is reported by a `frame` event, then a
//! `histogram` event, both with its ticket; a failed one by an `error` event.
//! A render that was overtaken reports nothing.
