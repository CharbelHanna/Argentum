//!
//! What the engine holds is counted, not read off the process: every byte
//! its Rust code allocates (a counting allocator for this test binary) and
//! every byte of GPU memory wgpu holds for its device (wgpu's allocator
//! report, its own staging copies included). Counted, it is the same on any
//! machine and any GPU, a software one included, so the budget is checked on
//! every pull request. The whole process's peak - the GPU driver's and the
//! operating system's share with it - is printed beside it, not checked: it
//! depends on the machine, not on the engine.
//!
//! A test binary of its own, with one test in it: the counting allocator is
